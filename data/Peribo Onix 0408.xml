			<Text>Today’s explosive and emerging economy is every business executive’s biggest opportunity—and most pressing threat. In the next decade, exponential trends in computers, bandwidth, gene sequencing, nanotechnology, and other fields will transform the global economy. However, many companies won’t realize the impact of these trends until their products and services become obsolete—almost overnight. Jump the Curve describes the 50 essential strategies managers and organizations must adopt to stay ahead of the curve. While other books such as The World Is Flat and The Tipping Point have explained the effect of accelerating technologies, Jump the Curve explains how to use exponential change to expand markets and create new products. It’s the book every product or service provider needs to stay ahead of the competition.                 AUTHOR: Jack Uldrich (Minneapolis, MN) is the president of The NanoVeritas Group, a leading international consultancy on business and technology. Clients include leading venture capital firms, state governments, and Fortune 100 companies. Uldrich’s work has appeared in the Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily, BusinessWeek, The Futurist and The Motley Fool. He is also a frequent commentator on CNN, MSNBC, and National Public Radio.</Text>

			<Text>Divorce. Work. Military deployment. There are many reasons fathers are not present in their children’s daily lives. But that doesn’t mean they have to be completely absent. This practical handbook, by the founder of the Divorced Fathers Network, tackles the challenges long-distance fathers face and offers solutions on how to maintain healthy, loving, and close relationships. It includes ways to: • Communicate via phone, e-mail, IM, Web cams, etc. • Create daily, weekly, monthly rituals of their very own • Stay involved in homework, sports, and school activities • Make the most of summer vacations, holidays, and vacations • Develop good working relationships with ex-spouses, coaches, teachers, etc. The bad news: Over the next century, 50 million American children will go to sleep without being tucked in at night by their fathers. The good news: The world grows smaller every day. With The Long-Distance Dad, fathers will find that it’s easier than ever to keep connected to their kids!&lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Steven Ashley (Santa Cruz, CA) is the founder of the Divorced Fathers Network and www.divorcedfathers.com. The author of the self-published Fathers Are Forever: A Co-Parenting Guide for the 21st Century, Mr. Ashley has helped hundreds of men and women create cooperative relationships with their former spouses for the benefit of the children. Ashley is a sought-after speaker and consultant to the media on behalf of fathers and their important contributions as parents.</Text>

			<Text>Mercedes has made a recent move to cut complexity: Designers who were previously allowed to design cars from the ground up are now required to choose from a common set of modules (BusinessWeek, Nov. 2, 2006) • Wal*Mart has recently exited Korea and Germany, citing its inability to deal with the many differences in the retail environment there • The business community is starting to realize that simplicity, not complexity, is marketable—as evidenced by the phenomenal success of the iPod and Google’s search engine. &lt;&lt; Many companies today are in crisis. Most troubling of all is that many of them aren’t even aware they are in jeopardy. In their quest to attain double-digit growth in single digit markets, companies have frantically created more products, customers, markets, suppliers, services, and locations. Yet all of this complexity adds costs. Thus, as topline revenues go up, bottomline profits go down—often precipitously. Worse yet, none of today’s accounting systems identify complexity costs until a company is on the edge—without understanding how they got there. The Complexity Crisis, by John L. Mariotti—the former president of Rubbermaid Office Products Group—shows readers how to track complexity and reduce or eliminate it—or alter processes to accommodate complexity that truly adds value to the business. Filled with examples of companies who have successfully conquered complexity, The Complexity Crisis shows readers how to institute new metrics and modifications to existing cost and management control systems so they can choose when to cut complexity out and when to capitalize on it.     AUTHOR: John L. Mariotti (Powell, OH) is the President/CEO &amp; Founder of The Enterprise Group, a coalition of timeshared executive advisors, which he founded in 1994. Prior to this, Mr. Mariotti was President of Rubbermaid Office Products Group. Before joining Rubbermaid, Mariotti led Huffy Bicycles as its President, to the preeminent position of industry leader in the U.S. He was Management Columnist and a Contributing Editor for IndustryWeek magazine for five years. Articles and interviews about his business career have been featured in the Wall Street Journal, Fortune, Boardroom Reports, IndustryWeek, BusinessWeek, and many more. He’s been a guest on CNBC’s Today’s Business and Power Lunch shows.</Text>

			<Text>In a comprehensive survey of this highly pertinent subject, leading academic Sandy Black examines the way the fashion industry is changing to accommodate the environmental concerns of the twenty first century. She exposes the naked truth behind the clothes we wear, exploring alternate practices and assessing their feasibility. &lt;&lt; Using case studies of designers from the catwalks and the high street, including Katherine Hamnett, Marks and Spencer and Linda Loudermilk, the book illustrates how these processes are finding their way into the industry, and shows how ethical fashion has moved on from its traditional connotations of hemp shirts and rope sandals.    Fashion and environmental awareness are two concerns that do not comfortably sit side by side. Over the past ten years, high street fashion, led by global chains, has become ever more affordable and disposable. The sourcing of materials, the manufacture and the distribution of clothes have become the dirty secrets of the beautiful industry.  Eco-Chic continues Black Dog’s commitment to the environment and to responsible design. Lavishly illustrated, it is a timely publication that will appeal equally to the fashion conscious and environmentally aware. 300 colour &amp; b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Tarkovsky provides a collection of accessible academic essays by leading film studies professionals. A challenging, broadly illustrated book that fully captures the essence of this cinematic pioneer.  “Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.” Andrei Tarkovsky    Andrei Tarkovsky is the most influential Soviet filmmaker of the post-war era, and one of the world’s most renowned cinematic geniuses. He created spiritual, existential films of incredible beauty, repeatedly returning to themes of memory, dreams, childhood and Christianity. His films, such as Solaris, Mirror, Nostalghia and The Sacrifice make use of long, unedited shots and wide angles in uncompromisingly formalistic statements that are as striking today as they were when they were first made. AUTHOR:  Nathan Dunne studied art history ay Cambridge University. He is currently working on a history of artist run galleries at the London Consortium. &lt;&lt; 350 colour &amp; b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Celia Scott profiles some of the artist’s best-known heads, from Eduardo Paolozzi to Colin St. John Wilson, with both a rigorous discussion of their aesthetic nature, and the engaging narrative surrounding their creation.   Celia Scott attempts to rescue public sculpture from its exclusively classical connotations, while at the same time employing the visual and formal language of classical method. The resulting work sets itself apart from the current architectural and artistic landscape, highlighting moments in the collective memory against the backdrop of modern experience. This classical approach chooses strange subjects, indeed most of Scott’s sitters were influenced by, and influential in, the modernist movement in architecture.  Alan Colquhoun opens this volume with a critical look at public sculpture and Scott’s place within, and outside of, its limits. In a characteristically robust analysis, Colquhoun examines the psychological and physical origins of Scott’s practice, and relates her work to the history and meaning of public sculpture.  AUTHOR: Alan Colquhoun is Professor Emeritus of Architecture at Princeton University, and one of the most important voices in ar chitectural theory of the last 50 years. &lt;&lt; 200 colour &amp; b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>In Trevor Dannatt: works and words, Professor Roger Stonehouse examines the full breadth of Dannatt’s architecture, ranging from the domestic and academic, such as the combination room for Trinity Hall College, University of Cambridge; to social buildings, such as the Victoria Gate at Kew; to international projects, such as the British Embassy buildings and King Feisal Conference Centre in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Trevor Dannatt, Royal Academician and former Professor of Architecture at the University of Manchester, was part of the wave of architects who qualified soon after the Second World War. Known both for his practical building work and his involvement, alongside contemporary and friend Colin St John Wilson, in the debate around the language of Modernism and the development of ‘humanist’ architecture, Dannatt began his career under Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew, leaving in 1948 to join the Festival Hall Group under Leslie Martin and former tutor Peter Moro. Illustrated by superb photographs and reproductions of original drawings, Trevor Dannatt: words and works will appeal to everyone interested in the order and elegance of Dannatt’s architecture, as well as his underlying philosophy AUTHOR: Roger Stonehouse is Professor Emeritus at The University of Manchester . &lt;&lt; 200 volour &amp; b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Samurai tells the story of the courageous and highly disciplined fighting men of this time, showing how they evolved from the promitive fighters o fthe seventh century into an invicible military caste with a fearsome reputation. &lt;&lt; In the early seventh century, the samurai rose to prominence during the struggles between the empror and the military leaders (shogun). They took part in the invasion of Korea, as well as helping to keep Japan free from foreign influence. From the Heian period through to the Onin wars, the history of the samurai is replete with tales of heroism and bloodshed. &lt;&lt; Although the samurai is most famous for his use of the sword, he also used a wide variety of other weapons, such as the crossbow, the dagger and the spear. Samurai armour and costume were constantly evolving, and by the twelfth century most samurai were wearing the box-like yoroi armour. Samurai examines samurai fighting tactics, as well as acts such as ritual suicide (hari-kiri) and the taking of enemy heads as trophies. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Stephen Turnbull is an Honorary Fellow at the Department of East Asian Studies at Leeds University. He is the author of more than fifty books on the military history of Europe and the Far EAst. He lives in Horsforth, Yorkshire. &lt;&lt;SELLINg POINTS: Tells the story of these courageous and highly disciplined warriors. &lt;&lt; Exmaines samurai weaponry and fighting tactics. &lt;&lt; Highly illustrated, shows development of costume and armour. &lt;&lt; Samurai provides a fascinating insight into the ways of the ancient warriors who led the military in Japan from the seventh century to the nineteenth century.

			<Text>Light has an amazing influence on mood. It can change the whole ambience of a room, from uplifting and energizing to calming and relaxing. Living with Light takes its inspiration from the northern hemisphere where winters are long and light at a premium, and techniques have been developed to make the most of every available second. &lt;&lt; The style of Scandinavian interiors has evolved from the people's connection to the seasons and nature. This ethos  never goes out of fashion and, all over the world, is as popular today as it has ever been. Pale, painted rooms with bleached floors reflect as much light as possible, even in winter when deep snow acts as a reflector during the short hours of daylight. Windows are solidly triplegalzed to keep the heat in so, with no need for heavy curtains, they can be simply swathed with fine fabric. In the summer, windows are thrown open and the light and air of the great outdoors wafts inside. &lt;&lt; Chapter by chapter, Living with Light elaborates on creative ideas for decorating the Scandinavian way, using pastel colors as well as the traditional muted palette, unusual fabrics, and display techniques that focus on everything from flowers to kitchenware. The homes featured in these pages are traditional, or crisply contemporary, and some have interprested the look in a uniquely personal way, but all are based on a central theme of making spaces light and airy. &lt;&lt;Living with Light is the perfect companion for anyone to give theire home a spacious feel, the Scandinavian way. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Gail Abbott is an established interior designer, stylist, and writer with over twenty years' experinece. Gail contributes regularly to home-style magazines, including Homes &amp; Gardens and Ideal Home, and was instrumental in setting up Angel + Blume, the Cambridge-based interior design company. This is her sixth book; the others include Shoestring Chic and So Simple Window Style. Gail lives in Cambridge. &lt;&lt; PHOTOGRAPHER: Mark Scott is a London-based lifestyle photographer specializing in interiors, gaardens, food and travel. His relaxed style and fresh lighting have earned him commissions from numerous magazines, book publishers, design groups and advertising agencies. &lt;&lt;300 colour photos</Text>

Over the course of nearly 50 years, Philip Johnson and David Whitney's 47 acre site in New Canaan, CT, became a canvas for their innovation in the fields of architecture, art and landscape design. In each decade new structures were built, artwork acquired and landscape sculptured to showcase the ideas and thoughts that were central to the conversations brought about by friends, colleagues and guests who were among the most famous leaders in these worlds. The Glass House, which Johnson bequeathed to The National Trust and opens to the public in the fall of 2007, is set to become a center point and catalyst for the preservation of Modern architecture, landscape and art. In the words of The Trust, "...a canvas for inspiration, experimentation and cultivation honoring the legacy of philip Johnson and David Whitney". The book will serve as a virtual visit of the house as well as a celebration of one of modern architecture's most famous creations.</Text>

			<Text>A highly topical book about the geopolitics of oil. 'Hiro's detail-packed prose lends an immediacy to events' Tribune   China is now the world's second largest energy consumer, trailing only behind America. And India has moved up into the fourth place behind Russia, after overtaking Japan in 2001.   Dramatically changing the geopolitics of oil in the new century, China and India are rapidly expanding their navies as they become increasingly dependent on lines of oil tankers from the Middle East, posing the beginning of an eventual challenge to American hegemony in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.  But while competition for oil sharpens — the world is approaching the projected peak oil output in 2012 — the number of countries able to export the commodity is shrinking. Those countries will be largely Muslim, or like Hugo Chavez's Venezuela, hostile to Western interests. The potential shortage of oil sets the stage for the coming oil wars of the 21st century.      About Dilip Hiro   Dilip Hiro is the author of Secrets and Lies: The True Story of the Iraq War and most recently Iran Today. He is a celebrated journalist, commentator and the author of over fifteen books on the Middle East.   Other titles by Dilip Hiro   Iran Today Secrets and Lies</Text>

			<Text>The first-ever biography of the most famous of Ireland's High Kings. Brian Boru king of Munster, was among the most successful of all medieval Irish monarchs. Succeeding to the kingship of Dal Cais on the death of his brother Mathgamain in 976, he managed in the course of his long reign, by a combination of military skill and political astuteness, to enforce his authority over much of the country. In so doing, he became the first ruler outside the Ui Neill to make a bid for the overlordship of Ireland, thereby indicating that the high kingship was in fact a prize to be won by the most powerful claimant. Brian fought Vikings, subdued other Irish kingdoms too, but was finally slain at the battle of Clontarf in 1014. His power largely died with him. Nevertheless, his descendents continued for generations to bask in his glory. How and why Brian acquired the legendary reputation he did in the thousand or so years following his death is the first step in understanding one of Ireland's great heroes, allowing us to come closer to the historical Brian.</Text>

			<Text>Margaret Mee must rank as one of the most remarkable women of the twentieth century. She was an intrepid explorer of the Brazilian rainforest and an outstanding botanical artist, acclaimed by botanists and art critics worldwide. At the age of 47, Mee started exploring the Amazon in the footsteps of great British explorers such as Richard Spruce and Henry Walter Bates travelling throughout the wildest parts of Amazonia for the next thirty years. Mee learned to live with the forest and its plants, animals and people and learnt much from the Indians about the trees and plants she so meticulously painted. Mee initially sketched the plants in the forest and then worked on the large illustrations of the entire plant in her studio in Rio de Janeiro. Nine of these plants recorded by Mee, previously unknown to science, are now named after her. "Flowers of the Amazon Forests: The Botanical Art of Margaret Mee" illustrates more than sixty of Mee's major works with additional sketches painted whilst in the forest. The text is taken directly from the diaries she kept whilst travelling giving a wonderful insight into the Amazon - something very few people have actually seen. Mee was an ardent conservationist and was well known for her outspoken views on the destructive exploitation of the Amazon forests. This book is a small tribute to her great work.                                                                                 200 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>With its unique in-built beauty, it is hardly surprising that old glass is one of the most popular collecting fields. Glass is to be found everywhere, from delicate wineglasses designed to make drinking a pleasure to ornamental lamps that illuminate and decorate. This book is a valuable starting point for enthusiasts. It tells you where to hunt for bargains and how to add rarities to a growing collection. An important section offers tips on what is available within any price range. It is filled with invaluable advice. How do you spot repairs or re-polishing? How can you avoid the proliferation of fakes while you learn to distinguish fine glass from ordinary? John Sandon's sensible guidance will prevent many costly mistakes. This book tells the whole story of glass, from its discovery in ancient Egypt right through to the fascinating world of the twentieth century and post-war design. The text is concise, informative and above all readable, written in the accessible style that makes John Sandon's book so popular. His carefully chosen illustrations, all in colour, provide stunning contrasts between fine old Venetian and Art Nouveau masterpieces and quite ordinary decanters and Victorian moulded bottles. Alongside costly rarities, one of the strengths of this book is the inclusion of inexpensive novelty glass anyone can find easily and cheaply. This book is aimed at the beginner on a modest budget as well as at established collectors.</Text>

			<Text>Continuing the readable, informative and helpful series 'Starting to Collect', this volume investigates one of the most thorny of collecting fields - antique oriental rugs. Novice collectors are in good hands here, for the author takes them through the initial problembatical areas - where to buy, what to look for, care and restoration, before turning his attention to the materials and techniques, dyes and designs, involved in the manufacture of rugs. In subsequent chapters on the output of different rug-producing locations, Dr. Eiland considers these area by area, so that, for instance, Persian rugs are discussed under eighteen area subheadings, including the Aegean region, Gordes, and the Anatolian coast. Within each chapter he considers the typical structure, size, designs and colours found in the area, together with any other significant features which will aid the new collector in identification. The body of the book presents and illustrates rugs from Persia, Turkey, the Caucasus, Afghanistan, China, and India, the areas conventionally associated with 'oriental' rug production, but Dr. Eiland, aware that comparisons with other rug-producing areas can be useful, complements his text with examples from Europe and Africa. He also includes chapters on flatwoven and modern rugs. In a work of this nature, where important points must be brought out succinctly and clearly, images are of primary interest, and some 170 carefully selected full colour illustrations show not only the richness and variety of these beautiful objects, but also the salient features from which collectors can learn to know their subject.</Text>

			<Text>Forming a collection of antique porcelain is surprisingly simple with the aid of this book, written by a foremost authority. John Sandon presents the essential information in a style which is both accessible and readable, offering all manner of practical advice to the novice and beginner. Where should you buy, what should you look for and how do you avoid fakes? Should you get a damaged piece restored? How much should you spend? The answers to these questions and many more are clearly presented. From its discovery in ancient China, the story of porcelain unfolds country by country as the secrets of manufacture were slowly passed from continent to continent. Clear colour illustrations have been carefully chosen to show the unique attributes of each kind of porcelain. Each entry lists specialist books which offer more information. This guide concludes with a general bibliography, details of makers' marks and the dates of Chinese reigns. Altogether this is a very special kind of reference book; its readable and knowledgable yet compact presentation will be appreciated by committed collectors and enthusiasts whilst giving the novice the confidence to follow in their footsteps.</Text>

			<Text>The twentieth century offers the new collector a wide range of opportunities to build up a collection, from coffee sets, dinner wares, decorative plaques, egg cups and even chamber pots to a whole range of novelties that were manufactured by the pottery industry across Europe and America. The market for collectables has expanded greatly over the last twenty years with many people starting to buy their first examples from local flea markets, car boot sales and auction houses. More recently new opportunities to buy and sell pottery have been established via the internet with auction sites such as eBay. This book is for any collector interested in 20th century ceramics, whether a collector who concentrates on one factory, on a single designer, such as Clarice Cliff, or on a type of item, such as toast racks, egg cups or preserve pots. Written by the award-winning author Andrew Casey, an acknowledged expert on twentieth-century ceramics</Text>

The result is a crystal-clear and brilliant book that forms a rich source of artistic inspiration and introspection. The design has been kept sober so as to give the book a unique zen-like atmosphere.  Text in English, Dutch, French and German.

			<Text>400 colour illustrations  An anthology of works owned by a private collector, comprising 400 pieces of art, by 236 artists. Includes concise narratives on the artists, and a text written by the collector himself that communicates his passion and individual taste   Challenged by his son Kristian Davies, the award winning author of Laynfaroh's first book, The Orientalists, to write the story of a forty-year passion for collecting American paintings, Tom Davies quickly found himself not only recalling events surrounding their acquisition but also recounting how the 'art gene' was passed from his father to him and onto his two sons. This Collecting Stories is unlike any other book focusing on a family's lifelong pursuit of its passion. It is written entirely by the collector, not simply a hired art historian. It communicates, at a personal level, the great joy and pleasure derived from the people (artists, dealers, museum personnel, and other collectors) encountered along the way, the lessons learned (both good and bad), and the satisfaction gained from increased knowledge and insight.  As the title states, there are 400 pieces of artwork, reflecting the ever-expanding interests of Mr. and Mrs. Davies, collected over forty years, ranging from 19th-century Hudson River School landscape, marine, genre, and still life to the work of expatriate artists in Europe and the Middle East, to the transitional period of Tonalism into Impressionism, Realism, art of the American West, illustration and contemporary artists of today. For the most part, the work is academic or representational. Reflecting the personal tastes of a private collection obtained without the aid of advisors, some schools or styles are more heavily represented than others. Reflecting financial realities (read: limitations) of the private collector, some examples by given artists are major, occasionally iconic, while others are smaller, more personal pieces.  Collecting Stories will appeal to art collectors but also to anyone with an interest, fascination, and desire to collect any objects. The serious collector or those seriously considering collecting will see themselves and will recognise those marvellous compulsions to pursue their passion-and will be a bit relieved to learn there are others like them who are, except for the 'collecting gene', relatively normal folks.</Text>

			<Text>First compilation of both furniture designs and architectural projects by Samuel Marx        Although Samuel Abraham Marx was born at the end of the 19th century, he had the eye of a modernist - as an architect, furniture designer, connoisseur and collector. His vision was neither ostentatious or grandiose, but subtle and quietly magnificent. Ultra-Modern, Samuel Marx, Architect, Designer, Art Collector is the first monograph on this lesser-known but increasingly influential American designer. In more than 200 photographs, Marx expert and decorative arts dealer, Liz O Brien, reveals many of his undiscovered projects including houses that have been raised despite preservationist protests and his range of furniture designs. Marx was also sought after for his ability to integrate art in well-heeled interiors. The private art collections of many of his wealthy clients have, in the last 40 years, been dispersed to major museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, as well as the Chicago Art Institute, in Chicago.        Liz O'Brien is a decorative arts dealer specialising in modern design. Her interest in American architect and furniture designer Samuel A. Marx began more than ten years ago when she first started to do research on his career. For the past decade she has showed his furniture designs in her New York gallery, making some of his best pieces available to interior designers and collectors. O'Brien is now recognised as a leading Marx expert and has been instrumental in placing him as an important figure in the history of 20th century architecture and design.    54 colour 164 b/w</Text>

			<Text>Francesco Xanto Avelli da Rovigo was an intriguing artist who painted some of the most beautiful and fascinating ceramics produced in Renaissance Italy. With surfaces entirely painted with scenes from classical literature, Roman history or the Bible, his dishes were much sought after by the educated elite of his time, and continue to fascinate ceramics enthusiasts today. The colours of his works appear as fresh now as when the pieces were first made, providing a sense of immediacy that brings the culture of Xanto’s Italy to life before our eyes.   Accompanying an exhibition at the Wallace Collection - the first ever dedicated to the artist - this book puts the work of Xanto and his contemporaries in its historical, political and artistic context. Xanto’s ‘cut and paste’ method of incorporating figures derived from prints is explored, his artistic development is traced and the spread of his influence assessed. Included is a full transcription of Xanto’s sonnet sequence, published, for the first time with an English translation. An appendix comprising a list of Xanto’s works is another ‘first’. Accompanies an exhibition at the Wallace Collection, London, opening 25 January.  John Mallet is curator of the exhibition, formerly Keeper in the Department of Ceramics and Glass in the Victoria and Albert Museum and the world authority on Xanto.         160 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>This book comes with an introduction and notes by Cedric Watts, Research Professor of English, University of Sussex. "Antony and Cleopatra" is one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies: a spectacular, widely-ranging drama of love and war, passion and politics. Antony is divided between the responsibilities of imperial power and the intensities of his sexual relationship with Cleopatra. She, variously generous and ruthless, loving and jealous, petulant and majestic, emerges as Shakespeare's most complex depiction of a woman: 'Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale/Her infinite variety.'</Text>

			<Text>With an Introduction and Notes by Professor Stephen Arkin, San Francisco State University  Katherine Mansfield is widely regarded as a writer who helped create the modern short story. Born in Wellinton, New Zealand in 1888, she came to London in 1903 to attend Queen's College and returned permanently in 1908. her first book of stories, In a German Pension, appeared in 1911, and she went on to write and publish an extraordinary body of work.       This addition of The Collected Stories brings together all of the stories that Mansfield had written up until her death in January of 1923. With an introduction and head-notes, this volume allows the reader to become familiar with the complete range of Mansfield's work from the early, satirical stories set in Bavaria, through the luminous recollections of her childhood in New Zealand, and through the mature, deeply felt stories of her last years. Admired by Virginia Woolf in her lifetime and by many writers since her death, Katherine Mansfield is one of the great literary artists of the twentieth century.</Text>

			<Text>The victim of a miscarriage of justice, Edmund Dantes is fired by a desire for retribution and empowered by a stroke of providence. In his campaign of vengeance, he becomes an anonymous agent of fate. This title includes an introduction and notes by Keith Wren, University of Kent at Canterbury. The story of Edmund Dantes, self-styled Count of Monte Cristo, is told with consummate skill. The victim of a miscarriage of justice, Dantes is fired by a desire for retribution and empowered by a stroke of providence. In his campaign of vengeance, he becomes an anonymous agent of fate. The sensational narrative of intrigue, betrayal, escape, and triumphant revenge moves at a cracking pace. Dumas' novel presents a powerful conflict between good and evil embodied in an epic saga of rich diversity that is complicated by the hero's ultimate discomfort with the hubristic implication of his own actions.</Text>

			<Text>Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is best known for "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina". This volume contains four of his stories: "Family Happiness", "The Kreutzer Sonata", "The Devil", and "The Death of Ivan Ilyich".   >>  This book comes with an introduction and notes by Dr T.C.B. CookCount. Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) is best known for "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina", commonly regarded as amongst the greatest novels ever written. He also, however, wrote many masterly short stories, and this volume contains four of the longest and best in distinguished translations that have stood the test of time. In the early story "Family Happiness", Tolstoy explores courtship and marriage from the point of view of a young wife. In "The Kreutzer Sonata" he gives us a terrifying study of marital breakdown, in "The Devil" a powerful depiction of the power of sexual temptation, and, in perhaps the finest of all, "The Death of Ivan Ilyich", he portrays the long agony of a man gradually coming to terms with his own mortality.</Text>

Living overseas but writing, always, about his native city, Joyce made Dublin unforgettable. The stories in "Dubliners" show us truants, seducers, gossips, rally-drivers, generous hostesses, corrupt politicians, failing priests, amateur theologians, struggling musicians, moony adolescents, victims of domestic brutishness, sentimental aunts and poets, patriots earnest or cynical, and people striving to get by. In every sense an international figure, Joyce was faithful to his own country by seeing it unflinchingly and challenging every precedent and piety in Irish literature.</Text>

			<Text>Set in Wessex countryside, this is a story of a young farmer Gabriel Oak and his love for and pursuit of the elusive Bathsheba Everdene, whose wayward nature leads her to both tragedy and true love.   >>  With introduction and notes by Norman Vance, Professor of English, University of Sussex, "Far from the Madding Crowd" is perhaps the most pastoral of Hardy's Wessex novels. It tells the story of the young farmer Gabriel Oak and his love for and pursuit of the elusive Bathsheba Everdene, whose wayward nature leads her to both tragedy and true love. It tells of the dashing Sergeant Troy whose rakish philosophy of life was '...the past was yesterday; never, the day after'. And lastly, of the introverted and reclusive gentleman farmer, Mr Boldwood, whose love fills him with '...a fearful sense of exposure', when he first sets eyes on Bathsheba. The background of this tale is the Wessex countryside in all its moods.</Text>

			<Text>This novel comes with an introduction and notes by Karl Ashley Smith, University of St Andrews and illustrations by Hablot K. Browne (Phiz). Mr Dombey is a man obsessed with his firm. His son is groomed from birth to take his place within it, despite his visionary eccentricity and declining health. But Dombey also has a daughter, whose unfailing love for her father goes unreturned. 'Girls' said Mr Dombey, 'have nothing to do with Dombey and Son'. When Walter Gay, a young clerk in her father's office, rescues her from a bewildering experience in the streets of London, his unforgettable friends believe he is well on his way to receiving her hand in marriage and inheriting the company. It is to be a very different type of story.</Text>

			<Text>This edition includes all ten of Henry James's "apparitional" stories, or ghost stories. They include: "The Jolly Corner", a story of psychological doubling; "Owen Wingrave", a parable of military tradition; and "The Friends of the Friends", a story of uncanny love.  >>  About this book: Henry James was arguably the greatest practitioner of what has been called the psychological ghost story. His stories explore the region which lies between the supernatural or straightforwardly marvellous and the darker areas of the human psyche. This edition includes all ten of his 'appacitional' stories, or ghost stories in the strict sense of the term, and as such is the fullest collection currently available. The stories range widely in tone and type. They include 'The Jolly Corner', a compelling story of psychological doubling; 'Owen Wingrave', which is also a subtle parable of military tradition; 'The Friends of the Friends', a strange story of uncanny love; and 'The Private Life', which finds high comedy in its ghostly theme. The volume also includes James's great novella 'The Turn of the Screw', perhaps the most ambiguous and disturbing ghost story ever written.</Text>

			<Text>Edited, Introduced and Annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of English Literature, University of Sussex   Hamlet is not only one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, but also the most fascinatingly problematical tragedy in world literature.  First performed around 1600, this a gripping and exuberant drama of revenge, rich in contrasts and conflicts. Its violence alternates with introspection, its melancholy with humour, and its subtlety with spectacle. The Prince, Hamlet himself, is depicted as a complex, divided, introspective character. His reflections on death, morality and the very status of human beings make him ‘ the first modern man’.</Text>

			<Text>Set in the imaginary mid-Victorian Northern industrial town of Coketown with its blackened factories, downtrodden workers and polluted environment, which is the the soulless domain of the strict utilitarian Thomas Gradgrind and the heartless factory owner Josiah Bounderby.  ..  This novel includes an introduction and notes by Dinny Thorold, University of Westminster and is illustrated by F. Walker and Maurice Greiffenhagen. Unusually for Dickens, "Hard Times" is set, not in London, but in the imaginary mid-Victorian Northern industrial town of Coketown with its blackened factories, downtrodden workers and polluted environment. This is the soulless domain of the strict utilitarian Thomas Gradgrind and the heartless factory owner Josiah Bounderby. However human joy is not excluded thanks to 'Mr Sleary's Horse-Riding' circus, a gin-soaked and hilarious troupe of open-hearted and affectionate people who act as an antidote to all the drudgery and misery endured by the ordinary citizens of Coketown.</Text>

			<Text>Introduction and Notes by Janet Beer. Manchester Metropolitan University  The House of Mirth tells the story of Lily Bart, aged 29, beautiful, impoverished and in need of a rich husband to safeguard her place in the social elite, and to support her expensive habits - her clothes, her charities and her gambling. Unwilling to marry without both love and money, Lily becomes vulnerable to the kind of gossip and slander which attach to a girl who has been on the marriage market for too long. Wharton charts the course of Lily’s life, providing, along the way, a wider picture of a society in transition, a rapidly changing New York where the old certainties of manners, morals and family have disappeared and the individual has become an expendable commodity.</Text>

This volume retells the story of Achilles, the great warrior, and his terrible wrath before the walls of besieged Troy, and the destruction it wreaks on both Greeks and Trojans. >>  With an introduction and notes by Adam Roberts, Royal Holloway, University of London, the product of more than a decade's continuous work (1598-1611), Chapman's translation of Homer's great poem of war is a magnificent testimony to the power of the Iliad. In muscular, onward-rolling verse Chapman retells the story of Achilles, the great warrior, and his terrible wrath before the walls of besieged Troy, and the destruction it wreaks on both Greeks and Trojans. Chapman regarded the translation of this epic, and of Homer's Odyssey (also available in Wordsworth Editions) as his life's work, and dedicated himself to capturing the 'soul' of the poem.</Text>

			<Text>This title includes introduction and notes by David Blair, University of Kent at Canterbury. Set in the reign of Richard I, Coeur de Lion, "Ivanhoe" is packed with memorable incidents - sieges, ambushes and combats - and equally memorable characters: Cedric of Rotherwood, the die-hard Saxon; his ward Rowena; the fierce Templar knight, Sir Brian de Bois-Gilbert; the Jew, Isaac of York, and his beautiful, spirited daughter Rebecca; Wamba and Gurth, jester and swineherd respectively. Scott explores the conflicts between the Crown and the powerful Barons, between the Norman overlords and the conquered Saxons, and between Richard and his scheming brother, Prince John. At the same time he brings into the novel the legendary Robin Hood and his band, and creates a brilliant, colourful account of the age of chivalry with all its elaborate rituals and costumes and its values of honour and personal glory.</Text>

Frustrated by poverty and the indifference of the academic institutions at the University of Christminster, his only chance of fulfilment seems to lie in his relationship with his unconventional cousin, Sue Bridehead. But life as social outcasts proves undermining, and when tragedy occurs, Sue has no resilience and Jude is left in despair.</Text>

			<Text>Dealing with events surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, this play illustrates the ways in which power and corruption are linked. The cry "Peace, freedom and liberty!" is used to clear brutal realities, while personal ambitions taint public actions.  >>  This book is edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, research Professor of English, University of Sussex. "Julius Caesar" is among the best of Shakespeare's historical and political plays. Dealing with events surrounding the assassination of Julius Caesar in 44 BC, the drama vividly illustrates the ways in which power and corruption are linked. The cry "Peace, freedom and liberty!" is used to exculpate brutal realities, while personal ambitions taint public actions. Rich in characterisation and replete with eloquent rhetoric, "Julius Caesar" remains engrossing and topical: a play for today.</Text>

			<Text>Introduction and Notes by Peter Preston, University of Nottingham   With Illustrations by Hablot K. Browne (Phiz)   Little Dorrit is a classic tale of imprisonment, both literal and metaphorical, while Dickens' working title for the novel, Nobody's Fault, highlights its concern with personal responsibility in private and public life. Dickens' childhood experiences inform the vivid scenes in Marshalsea debtor's prison, while his adult perceptions of governmental failures shape his satirical picture of the Circumlocution Office. The novel's range of characters - the honest, the crooked, the selfish and the self-denying - offers a portrait of society about whose values Dickens had profound doubts.</Text>

			<Text>Edited, Introduced and Annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of English Literature, University of Sussex   Its lyricism, comedy (both broad and subtle) and magical transformations have long made A Midsummer Night's Dream one of the most popular of Shakespeare's works. The supernatural and the mundane, the illusory and the substantial, are all shimmeringly blended. Love is treated as tragic, poignant, absurd and farcical. 'Lord, what fools these mortals be!', jeers Robin Goodfellow; but the joke may be on him and on his master Oberon when Bottom the weaver, his head transformed into that of an ass, is embraced by the voluptuously amorous Titania.</Text>

			<Text>This title includes an Introduction and Notes by David Herd, lecturer in English and American Literature at the University of Kent at Canterbury. "Moby-Dick" is the story of Captain Ahab's quest to avenge the whale that 'reaped' his leg. The quest is an obsession and the novel is a diabolical study of how a man becomes a fanatic. But it is also a hymn to democracy. Bent as the crew is on Ahab's appalling crusade, it is equally the image of a co-operative community at work: all hands dependent on all hands, each individual responsible for the security of each. Among the crew is Ishmael, the novel's narrator, ordinary sailor, and extraordinary reader. Digressive, allusive, vulgar, transcendent, the story Ishmael tells is above all an education: in the practice of whaling, in the art of writing.</Text>

			<Text>Edited, introduced and annotated by Cedric Watts, Research Professor of English, University of Sussex  Much Ado About Nothing has long been celebrated as one of Shakespeare's most popular comedies. The central relationship, between Benedick and Beatrice, is wittily combative until love prevails. Broader comedy is provided by Dogberry, Verges and the watchmen. The drama ranges between the destructively sinister and the lyrically romantic, giving the whole a complex and sometimes problematic character.</Text>

			<Text>This novel comes with an Introduction and Notes by Peter Preston, University of Nottingham and illustrations by Hablot K. Browne (Phiz) and George Cruickshank. "The Old Curiosity Shop" (1840-41), with its combination of the sentimental, the grotesque and the socially concerned, and its story of pursuit and courage, which sets the downtrodden and the plucky against the malevolent and the villainous, was an immediate popular success. Little Nell quickly became one of Dickens' most celebrated characters, who so captured the imagination of his readers that while the novel was being serialised, many of them wrote to him about her fate.</Text>

			<Text>A Pair of Blue Eyes is celebrated for its central scene which shocked and stimulated Victorian readers. Forever after it caused Hardy to be embroiled in arguments concerning the sexual morality of his novels in which he strove to show the stifling effects of social conventions on the human spirit. Rich with biographical echoes, this novel reveals the full emergence of the schematic ironies which characterize Hardy's later great works, and gives a suggestion of the tragic philosophy that came to dominate all he wrote.  The loving nature of the heroine, Elfride Swancourt, pervades this novel, which has a singular unpolished charm.</Text>

			<Text>This book includes an introduction and notes by Doreen Roberts, Rutherford College, University of Kent at Canterbury. "Tom Jones" is widely regarded as one of the first and most influential English novels. It is certainly the funniest. Tom Jones, the hero of the book, is introduced to the reader as the ward of a liberal Somerset squire. Tom is a generous but slightly wild and feckless country boy with a weakness for young women. Misfortune, followed by many spirited adventures as he travels to London to seek his fortune, teach him a sort of wisdom to go with his essential good-heartedness.</Text>

			<Text>Tom Sawyer, an adventurous boy, is as much at home in the respectable world of his Aunt Polly as in the self-reliant and parentless world of his friend Huck Finn. The two enjoy a series of adventures, accidentally witnessing a murder, establishing the innocence of the man wrongly accused, as well as being hunted by Injun Joe, the true murderer.     This title includes an introduction and notes by Stuart Hutchinson, University of Kent at Canterbury. Tom Sawyer, a shrewd and adventurous boy, is as much at home in the respectable world of his Aunt Polly as in the self-reliant and parentless world of his friend Huck Finn. The two enjoy a series of adventures, accidentally witnessing a murder, establishing the innocence of the man wrongly accused, as well as being hunted by Injun Joe, the true murderer, eventually escaping and finding the treasure that Joe had buried. "Huckleberry Finn" recounts the further adventures of Huck, who runs away from a drunken and brutal father, and meets up with the escaped slave Jim. They float down the Mississippi on a raft, participating in the lives of the characters they meet, witnessing corruption, moral decay and intellectual impoverishment.Sharing so much in background and character, these two stories, the best of Twain, indisputably belong together in one volume. Though originally written as adventure stories for young people, the vivid writing provides a profound commentary on provincial American life in the mid-nineteenth century and the institution of slavery.</Text>

			<Text>Edited, Introduced and Annotated by Cedric Watts, Professor of English, University of Sussex  The gentle melancholy and lyrical atmosphere of Twelfth Night have long made the play a favourite with Shakespearian audiences. The plot revolves around mistaken identities and unrequited love, but is further enlivened by a comic sub-plot of considerable accomplishment. In it, Sir Toby Belch and his companion outwit the pretentious Malvolio, who despite suffering their most outrageous and insulting practical jokes, emerges as an almost noble figure.</Text>

"Uncle Tom's Cabin" is the most popular, influential and controversial book written by an American. Stowe's rich, panoramic novel passionately dramatises why the whole of America is implicated in and responsible for the sin of slavery, and resoundingly concludes that only 'repentance, justice and mercy' will prevent the onset of 'the wrath of Almighty God!'.</Text>

			<Text>This book comes with an introduction and notes by Owen Knowles, University of Hull. Thackeray's upper-class Regency world is a noisy and jostling commercial fairground, predominantly driven by acquisitive greed and soulless materialism, in which the narrator himself plays a brilliantly versatile role as a serio-comic observer. Although subtitled 'A Novel without a Hero', "Vanity Fair" follows the fortunes of two contrasting but inter-linked lives. Through the retiring Amelia Sedley and the brilliant Becky Sharp, Thackeray examines the position of women in an intensely exploitative male world.</Text>

			<Text>The Prophet represents the acme of Kahlil Gibran's achievement. Writing in English, Gibran adopted the tone and cadence of King James I's Bible, fusing his personalised Christian philosophy with a spirit and oriental wisdom that derives from the richly mixed influences of his native Lebanon. His language has a breath-taking beauty. Before returning to his birthplace, Almustafa, the 'prophet', is asked for guidance by the people of Orphalese. His words, redolent with love and understanding, call for universal unity, and affirm Gibran's certainty of the correlated nature of all existence, and of reincarnation. 'The Prophet' has never lost its immediate appeal and has become a ubiquitous touchstone of spiritual literature.</Text>

			<Text>Tells the story of the unjustly exiled Silas Marner - a handloom linen weaver of Raveloe in the agricultural heartland of England - and how he is restored to life by the unlikely means of the orphan child Eppie.   This title includes introduction and notes by R.T. Jones, Honorary Fellow of the University of York. Although the shortest of George Eliot's novels, "Silas Marner" is one of her most admired and loved works. It tells the sad story of the unjustly exiled Silas Marner - a handloom linen weaver of Raveloe in the agricultural heartland of England - and how he is restored to life by the unlikely means of the orphan child Eppie. "Silas Marner" is a tender and moving tale of sin and repentance set in a vanished rural world and holds the reader's attention until the last page as Eppie's bonds of affection for Silas are put to the test.</Text>

			<Text>Edgar Poe was born the son of itinerant actors on January 19th, 1809 in Boston, Massachusets. Abandoned by his father and the later death of his mother, he was taken into the foster care of John Allan, a Virginia tobacco farmer. Now styled as Edgar Allan Poe, he distinguished himself at the University of Virginia but was equally adept at collecting debts from his assiduous gambling. His stepfather's disapproval shattered their fragile relationship and Poe left home to seek his fortune.  In 1836 he married his cousin Virginia but despite his prolific activities - journalism, poetry, lecturing, short stories, publishing, criticism and experimentation with fictional genres, including the detective novel which he virtually invented with the publication of 'The Murders in the Rue Morgue' (1841) - he received scant recognition for his efforts until the publication of 'The Raven' in 1845. The poem's instant popularity gave him a new visibility in literary circles, but his personal situation remained desperate: poverty, illness, drink, and the physical decline and ultimate death of Virginia in 1847 led to his untimely and premature decline. In 1849 he was found sick, injured and semi-conscious in a Baltimore tavern. Taken to hospital, he lingered on for four days, but never recovered and on October 7th Edgar Allan Poe died at the age of 40.  He was one of the most original writers in the history of American letters - a genius who, thanks to his dire reputation, was tragically misunderstood during his lifetime. It was not until Baudelaire enthusiastically translated his work that he found a wider audience in Europe, and became not only an enormous influence on modern French literature but also on the acclaimed work of writers such as Dostoevsky, Conan Doyle and Jules Verne.</Text>

			<Text>Jacob Grimm (1785-1863) and his brother Wilhelm (1786-1859) were philologists and folklorists. The brothers rediscovered a host of fairy tales, telling of princes and princesses in their castles, witches in their towers and forests, of giants and dwarfs, of fabulous animals and dark deeds. Together with the well-known tales of 'Rapunzel', 'The Goose Girl', Sleeping Beauty', 'Hansel and Gretel' and 'Snow White', there are the darker tales such as 'Death's Messengers' which deserve to be better known, and which will appeal not only to all who are interested in the history of folklore, but also to all those who simply love good story-telling</Text>

			<Text>Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson) is famed for his magical stories, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, here illustrated throughout the inner pages by Sir John Tenniel's much loved drawings. However, inspired by the insatiable Victorian appetite for party games, tricks and conundrums, this eccentric and polymathical Englishman also wrote many other works of a humorous, witty, whimsical and nonsensical nature such as the mock-heroic nonsense verse The Hunting of the Snark, as well as dozens of other verses, stories, acrostics and puzzles, all of which are included in this volume. Oxford scholar, Church of England Deacon, University Lecturer in Mathematics and Logic, academic author of learned theses, gifted pioneer of portrait photography, colourful writer of imaginative genius and yet a shy and pedantic man, Lewis Carroll stands pre-eminent in the pantheon of inventive literary geniuses.</Text>

			<Text>Jane Austen is without question, one of England's most enduring and skilled novelists. With her wit, social precision, and unerring ability to create some of literature's most charismatic and believable heroines, she mesmerises her readers as much today as when her novels were first published. Whether it is her sharp, ironic gaze at the Gothic genre invoked by the adventures of Catherine Morland in "Northanger Abbey"; the diffident and much put-upon Fanny Price struggling to cope with her emotions in "Mansfield Park"; her delightfully paced comedy of manners and the machinations of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in "Sense and Sensibility"; the quiet strength of Anne Elliot in "Persuasion" succeeding in a world designed to subjugate her very existence; and "Emma" - 'a heroine whom no one but myself will like' teased Austen - yet another irresistible character on fire with imagination and foresight. Indeed not unlike her renowned creator. Jane Austen is as sure-footed in her steps through society's whirlpools of convention and prosaic mores as she is in her sometimes restrained but ever precise and enduring prose.</Text>

			<Text>Adam Bede was George Eliot's first full-length novel. Set in the English Midlands of farmers and village craftsmen at the turn of the eighteenth century, the book tells a story of seduction, and is also a pioneering record of a long lost rural world.  Middlemarch is a complex tale of idealism, disillusion, profligacy, loyalty and frustrated love. This penetrating analysis of the life of an English provincial town is told through the lives of Dorothea Brooke and Dr Tertius Lydgate, illuminating the condition of English life in the mid-nineteenth century.  The Mill on the Floss is a masterpiece of ambiguity in which moral choice is subjected to the hypocrisy of the Victorian age. Maggie Tulliver's love for her brother Tom turns to conflict. His bourgeois standards contrasting with her own lively intelligence, and the result, is tragedy.  Silas Marner tells the tender and moving story of the unjustly exiled linen weaver, Silas Marner of Raveloe in the agricultural heartland of England. It tells of how he is restored to life and his sadness ended by the unlikely means of the orphan child Eppie.</Text>

			<Text>Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875) was born in Odense, the son of a shoemaker. His early life was wretched, but he was adopted by a patron and became a short-story writer, novelist and playwright, though he remains best-known for his magical fairy tales which were published between 1835 and 1872. For 150 years his stories have been delighting both adults and children. Packed with a light-hearted whimsy combined with a mature wisdom they are as entrancing as ever. Here are all of Andersen's 168 tales, and among the favourites are 'The Red Shoes', 'The Mermaid', 'The Real Princess', 'The Emperor's New Clothes', The Tinder Box' and of course 'The Ugly Duckling'.</Text>

			<Text>The Jungle Book introduces Mowgli, the boy foundling adopted by a family of wolves, Shere Khan the tiger, Bagheera the black panther and Baloo the sleepy brown bear.  How did the Leopard get his spots? How did the Elephant get his trunk? In Just So Stories Kipling wittily supplies the answers to these and other questions.  Puck of Pook's Hill relates how Dan and Una's magical meeting with Puck, the last of the People of the Hills, leads to their adventures with Romans and Crusaders, Saxons and Vikings...  And later, in Rewards and Fairies, the three meet an array of characters ranging from Iron Age warriors to 'Good Queen Bess' and Sir Francis Drake.  In Kipling's rattling school yarn Stalky &amp; Co, Stalky, M'Turk and the Beetle are a trio of scallywags with a keen desire to break the rules, their unruly activities give the stories an enduring appeal to all children - especially those who have ever wilted beneath the stern glance of a peevish schoolmaster. Kipling's wry, sometimes tongue-in-cheek style will delight and entertain young readers while adults throughout the world will remember his stories with affection.</Text>

			<Text>Lord Jim, first published in 1900, confirmed Conrad's place in literature as one of the first 'modernists' of English letters. Set in the Malay Archipelago, not only does the novel provide a gripping account of maritime adventure and romance, but also an exotic tale of the East.  Nostromo is the only man capable of the decisive action needed to save the silver of the San Tome mine and secure independence for Sulaco, Occidental Province of the Latin American state of Costaguana. Is his integrity as unassailable as everyone believes, or will his ideals, like those which have inspired the struggling state itself, buckle under economic and political pressure?  The Secret Agent, Conrad's story of espionage and anarchists, tells of Winnie Verloc and her devotion to her peculiar and simple-minded brother, Stevie. Its savagely witty themes of human absurdity and misunderstanding are written in an ironic style that provokes both laughter and unease.  This volume also includes a selection of Conrad's matchless short stories - Youth, Typhoon, Heart of Darkness, The End of the Tether and The Shadow-Line</Text>

Although Charlotte Bronte's heroine is outwardly plain, she possesses an indomitable spirit, and great courage. Forced to battle against the exigencies of a cruel guardian, a harsh employer and a rigid social order when she becomes governess to the daughter of the mysterious, sardonic Mr Rochester. Villette is based on Charlotte Bronte's personal experience as a teacher in Brussels. Rising above the confinement of a rigid social order, it is the story of a woman's right to love and be loved. Wuthering Heights is Emily Bronte's wild, passionate tale of the intense love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, a foundling adopted by Catherine's father. Agnes Grey is Anne Bronte's trenchant expose of the frequently isolated, intellectually stagnant and emotionally starved conditions under which many governesses worked in the mid-nineteenth century. The Tenant of Wildfell Hall is a powerful and sometimes violent novel of expectation, love, oppression, sin and betrayal. It portrays the disintegration of the marriage of Helen Huniingdon, the mysterious 'tenant' of the title, and her dissolute, alcoholic husband.</Text>

			<Text>This collection brings together perhaps the finest of Dickens' shorter novels, filled with event, character, and the unsurpassed brilliance of his story-telling.  Oliver Twist enhanced and strengthened Dickens' reputation and contains classic Dickensian themes - grinding poverty, desperation, fear, temptation and the eventual triumph of good in the face of great adversity. Hard Times was attacked by Macaulay for its 'sullen socialism', but 20th-century critics - George Bernard Shaw and F.R. Leavis praised it in the highest terms.  A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens' greatest historical novel, traces the lives of a group of people caught up in the cataclysm of the French Revolution and the Terror. A fascinating range of characters and Dickens' usual superb command of language combine to make this an exciting and tantalising story. Great Expectations traces the life of Philip Pirrip (Pip), from a boy of shallow dreams to a man of character. From its dramatic opening on the bleak Kentish marshes, the story abounds with memorable characters - the blacksmith Joe Gargery, the mysterious convict Abel Magwitch, the eccentric Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella.</Text>

			<Text>A richly entertaining and exciting collection of mystery and detective stories from the golden age of crime fiction. This was a period when crimes were solved by the wit and ingenuity of the sleuth who only had his own intelligence to rely on rather than a battery of scientific devices and procedures employed by the modern crime solver. Within these pages you will meet such fascinating sleuths as G.K. Chesterton's Mr Pond, Ernest Bramah's remarkable blind detective, Max Carrados, who can read newspapers by allowing his sensitive fingers to run over the print, Craig Kennedy, 'the American Sherlock Holmes' created by Arthur B. Reeve, and Jacques Futrelle's Professor S.F.X. Van Dusen, 'The Thinking Machine' amongst others. Tales by Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, Arnold Bennett, Rudyard Kipling, Edgar Allan Poe and Arthur Conan Doyle will thrill and puzzle you.</Text>

			<Text> The two political works in this text are the product of a time of intense turmoil in Chinese history. Dating from an epoch in Chinese history known as the "Period of the Warring States" (4003 - 221 BC), they anticipate by nearly 2000 years Niccolo Machiavelli's treatises on the same subjects.</Text>

			<Text>Translated by John Dryden and others, edited by Sir Samuel Garth.  With an Introduction by Garth Tissol  Ovid's Metamorphoses, completed around AD8, shows the presence and prevalence of change in the world. Beginning with chaos and creation, Ovid embraces a vast array of mythological tales within his theme of transformation. Phaeton, Narcissus, Pyramus and Thisbe, Daedalus and Icarus are only a few of the most famous. Passing through these to the serio-comic retellings of the Trojan War, the travels of Aeneas, and the events of Roman history down to Ovid's own times, his readers find infinite variety in a work that is, by turns, funny, pathetic and violent - always unpredictable and always engrossing. John Dryden's translations are featured in this collaborative Metamorphoses, first issued in 1717, to which eighteen translators contributed under the editorship of Sir Samuel Garth. Composed in a poetic idiom well suited to the satiric and mock-heroic aspects of this work, this is the only translation that can match Ovid's wit and stylistic sophistication.</Text>

			<Text>Translated by J.J. Graham, revised by F.N. Maude  Abridged and with an Introduction by Louise Willmot  On War is perhaps the greatest book ever written about war. Carl von Clausewitz, a Prussian soldier, had witnessed at first hand the immense destructive power of the French Revolutionary armies which swept across Europe between 1792 and 1815. His response was to write a comprehensive text covering every aspect of warfare. On War is both a philosophical and practical work in which Clausewitz defines the essential nature of war, debates the qualities of the great commander, assesses the relative strengths of defensive and offensive warfare, and - in highly controversial passages - considers the relationship between war and politics. His arguments are illustrated with vivid examples drawn from the campaigns of Frederick the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte. For the student of society as well as the military historian, On War remains a compelling and indispensable source.</Text>

			<Text>Anton Chekhov’s popularity in the west is without parallel for a foreign writer. He has been absorbed into our culture, and accepted as one of our own. His plays lend themselves easily to the stage, calling for actors with intelligence and common sense rather than a dramatic voice or histrionic skills. He takes from everyday life themes of frustration which apply to us all – the difficulty of carving out a happy existence, the problems of love, the fading of hope, the universal feeling that time passes and we never quite get things right.   This seems pessimistic, and yet Chekhov claimed he was writing comedy. Readers, actors and directors must decide for themselves which way to play these pieces. They are full of sadness, but a sadness described as the ‘darkness of the last hour before the dawn’. Whether tragic or comic, however, they are works of the first importance. The Cherry Orchard has been described as ‘the best play since Shakespeare’, Three Sisters as ‘the best play in the world’.</Text>

			<Text>Rousseau argues for the preservation of individual freedom in political society. An individual can only be free under the law, he says, by voluntarily embracing that law as his own. Hence, being free in society requires each of us to subjugate all our desires to the collective good, the general will. This text is not only a defence of civil society, but also a study of the darker side of political systems.</Text>

			<Text>These simple tales embody truths so powerful, the titles of the individual fables - the fox and the grapes, the dog in the manger, the wolf in sheep's clothing and many others - have entered the languages and idioms of most European tongues.The highest standards in editing and production have been applied to the Wordsworth Children's Classics, while the low price makes them affordable for everyone. Wordsworth's list covers a range of the best-loved stories for children, from nursery tales, classic fables, and fairy tales to stories that will appeal to older children and adults alike. Many of these volumes have contemporary illustrations, and while they are ideal for shared family reading, their attractive format will also encourage children to read for themselves. Like all Wordsworth Editions, these children's books represent unbeatable value.</Text>

			<Text> When Jerry, Jimmy and Cathy discover a tunnel that leads to a castle, they pretend that it is enchanted. But when they discover a Sleeping Princess at the centre of a maze, astonishing things begin to happen. Amongst a horde of jewels they discover a ring that grants wishes. But wishes granted are not always wishes wanted, so the children find themselves grappling with invisibility, dinosaurs, a ghost and the fearsome Ugli-Wuglies before it is all resolved. This edition of The Enchanted Castle has forty-seven evocative illustrations by H.R. Millar</Text>

			<Text>Little Women is one of the best-loved children's stories of all time, based on the author's own youthful experiences. It describes the family life of the four March sisters living in a small New England community, Meg, the eldest, is pretty and wishes to be a lady; Jo, at fifteen is ungainly and unconventional with an ambition to be an author; Beth is a delicate child of thirteen with a taste for music and Amy is a blonde beauty of twelve. The story of their domestic adventures, their attempts to increase the family income, their friendship with the neighbouring Lawrence family, and their later love affairs remains as fresh and beguiling as ever.   Good Wives takes up the story of the March sisters, some three years later, when, as young adults, they must face up to the inevitable trials and traumas of everyday life in their search for individual happiness.</Text>

			<Text>The magical Peter Pan comes to the night nursery of the Darling children, Wendy, John and Michael. He teaches them to fly, then takes them through the sky to Never-Never Land, where they find Red Indians, wolves, Mermaids and... Pirates. The leader of the pirates is the sinister Captain Hook. His hand was bitten off by a crocodile, who, as Captain Hook explains 'liked me arm so much that he has followed me ever since, licking his lips for the rest of me'. After lots of adventures, the story reaches its exciting climax as Peter, Wendy and the children do battle with Captain Hook and his band.</Text>

			<Text>Rewards and Fairies is a collection of stories and a sequel to Puck of Pook's Hill and, as Kipling wrote, 'The tales had to be read by children, before people realised they were meant for grown-ups'. Through the agency of Puck, two children - Dan and Una - meet a glittering array of historical characters from flint and iron age tribes to 'Good Queen Bess' and Sir Francis Drake. Other tales include stories of England following the Norman Conquest and the Europe of Napoleon and Talleyrand. Rewards and Fairies includes two of Kipling's best-loved and most quoted poems: 'The Way Through the Woods' and 'If-'</Text>

			<Text>Lively and mischievous, idle and brave, Tom Brown is both the typical boy of his time and the perennial hero celebrated by authors as diverse as Henry Fielding (in Tom Jones) and Alec Waugh (in The Loom of Youth).  The book describes Tom's time at Rugby School from his first football match, through his troubled adolescence when he is savagely bullied by the unspeakable Flashman, to his departure for a wider world as a confident young man.  This classic tale of a boy's schooldays under the benevolent eye of the renowned Dr Arnold still retains the appeal for which it was acclaimed on its first publication in 1857.  In its less well-known sequel, Tom Brown at Oxford, we follow our hero to St Ambrose's College, and, in sharing his undergraduate experiences, gain a vivid impression of university life in the mid nineteenth century.</Text>

			<Text>'Fifteen men on the dead man's chest-Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!' Treasure Island is a tale of pirates and villains, maps, treasure and shipwreck. When young Jim Hawkins finds a packet in Captain Flint's sea chest, he could not know that the map inside it would lead him to unimaginable treasure. Shipping as cabin boy on the Hispaniola, he sails with Squire Trelawney, Captain Smollett, Dr Livesey, the sinister Long John Silver and a frightening crew to Treasure Island. There, mutiny, murder and mayhem lead to a thrilling climax.</Text>

			<Text>What Katy Did at School and What Katy Did Next continue the story of the high-spirited and rebellious American girl, Katy Carr, and her family, who first appeared in What Katy Did. What Katy Did at School is a compelling tale of the intrigues of life at the New England girls’ boarding school which Katy attends. Her trials and adventures are all interwoven with a sense of fun and gently ironic good humour. What Katy Did Next describes a tour by Katy of Europe as she evolves from the child of earlier books into a spirited young woman, and brings to a satisfying close this delightful trilogy.</Text>

			<Text>When a huge cyclone transports the orphan Dorothy and her little dog Toto from Kansas to the Land of Oz, she fears that she will never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry ever again. But she meets the Munchkins, and they tell her to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City where the Wonderful Wizard of Oz will grant any wish. On the way, she meets the brainless Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion. The four friends set off to seek their heart's desires, and in a series of action-packed adventures they encounter a deadly poppy field, fierce animals, flying monkeys, a wicked witch, a good witch, and the Mighty Oz himself.</Text>

			<Text>While no collection of limericks can claim to be ‘complete', The Wordsworth Book of Limericks contains an astonishing collection of over 1,800 verses - all of them comical, and a great number so far from cleanliness as to verge on the obscene. This is not a book for the prurient, but it will give enormous pleasure to all who relish the unique art-form of the limerick. Whether this book is kept by the bed or by the loo, perhaps buyers should ask themselves the question that Mervyn Griffith-Jones QC put to the Lady Chatterly jury in 1960: 'Is this a book you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?'</Text>

			<Text>Dreams have variously inspired and haunted kings, poets, inventors, artists, musicians, statesmen and others since the dawn of recorded experience. Miller's Dictionary of Dreams first appeared in 1909, ten years after Sigmund Freud's pioneering work The Interpretation of Dreams, and is therefore an historical work on dream analysis first published at the time of a quantum leap in human consciousness.</Text>

			<Text>Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941) is rightly regarded as one of the founders of modern anthropology. "The Golden Bough", his masterpiece, appeared in twelve volumes between 1890 and 1915. This volume is the author's own abridgement of his great work, and was first published in 1922. Remarkable for its vast assembly of facts and its charm of presentation, it offers the thesis that man progresses from magic through religious belief to scientific thought. It discusses fertility rites, human sacrifice, the dying god, the scapegoat and many other symbols and practices which have influenced a whole generation of 20th century writers, including D.H. Lawrence, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot.</Text>

			<Text>With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies  'I saw him take a different shape before my eyes. His loose draperies fell about him...and there issued out of them a monstrous creature of the beetle tribe...'  From out of the dark and mystic Egypt come The Beetle, a creature of horror, 'born of neither God nor man', which can change its form at will. It is bent on revenge for a crime committed against the devotees of an ancient religion. At large in London, it pursues its victims without mercy and no one, it seems, is safe from its gruesome clutches.  Richard Marsh's weird, compelling and highly original novel, which once outsold Dracula, is both a horror masterpiece and a fin de siecle melodrama embracing the fears and concerns of late Victorian society. Long out of print, The Beetle is now available in this Wordsworth edition, ready to chill you to the marrow and give you nightmares.</Text>

			<Text>Vampires, those dark children of the night, who rise from their coffins to suck the blood of the living, continue to hold a strange fascination and dread. In this unique collection of vampire stories you will find some of the earliest depictions of these fearful creatures as in John Polidori's "The Vampyre" and James Malcolm Rymer's "Varney the Vampyre", a tale which held readers in thrall when it was first published in the mid-nineteenth century. As well as these rare stories and those featuring the more well known bloodsuckers such as Le Fanu's "Carmilla" and Stoker's "Dracula", there is a clutch of lesser known but equally frightening tales written by expert practitioners in the art of raising goose pimples. "Children of the Night" is a volume filled with the rich blood of chilling vampire fiction.</Text>

			<Text>With an Introduction by M.J. Elliot    The sixteenth-century Puritan Solomon Kane has a thirst for justice which surpasses common reason. Sombre of mood, clad in black and grey, he ‘never sought to analyse his motives and he never wavered once his mind was made up. Though he always acted on impulse, he firmly believed that all his actions were governed by cold and logical reasonings… A hunger in his soul drove him on and on, an urge to right all wrongs, protect all weaker things, and avenge all crimes against right and justice’.    Immune to the attractions of the opposite sex, he seems drawn by some psychological distress beacon to places where he knows only that he will be called upon to defend the helpless or (more often) exact retribution on their behalf. Himself a Christian, possessed of enormous strength and skill in swordplay, he yet has little hesitation in calling upon the assistance of his Voodoo-practising friend N’Longa when strength, skill and Christian belief are not enough.</Text>

			<Text>The great oaken gate heaved and splintered, and a monstrous beast as huge as a horse appeared at the mouth of the den; his small head was laid back on his hairy shoulders, his little eyes gleamed wickedly, and his red mouth opened snarling fiercely.  Undeservedly, the weird and chilling ghost stories of Arthur Christopher Benson and Robert Hugh Benson have been neglected for far too long. This volume attempts to rectify that situation. This dark banquet of tales take us to strange, unworldly and often archaic environments, far removed from the manic pace and pressures of the twenty-first century, but as exercises in the art of luring the reader into a state of unease, they are as potent as they were when the ink was barely dry on the page.</Text>

			<Text>Jane Austen is without question, one of England's most enduring and skilled novelists. With her wit, social precision, and unerring ability to create some of literature's most charismatic and believable heroines, she mesmerises her readers as much today as when her novels were first published. Whether it is her sharp, ironic gaze at the Gothic genre invoked by the adventures of Catherine Morland in "Northanger Abbey"; the diffident and much put-upon Fanny Price struggling to cope with her emotions in "Mansfield Park"; her delightfully paced comedy of manners and the machinations of the sisters Elinor and Marianne in "Sense and Sensibility"; the quiet strength of Anne Elliot in "Persuasion" succeeding in a world designed to subjugate her very existence; and Emma - 'a heroine whom no one but myself will like' teased Austen - yet another irresistible character on fire with imagination and foresight.Indeed not unlike her renowned creator, Jane Austen is as sure-footed in her steps through society's whirlpools of convention and prosaic mores as she is in her sometimes restrained but ever precise and enduring prose.  &lt;&lt; AUTHOR:  Jane Austen (16 December 1775–18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose works include Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, and Persuasion. Her social commentary and masterful use of both free indirect speech and irony eventually made Austen one of the most influential and honoured novelists in English literature. Her novels were all written and set around the Regency Era. She never married and died at age 41.</Text>

			<Text>Arthur Conan Doyle is best remembered today as the creator of the world’s most famous detective, Sherlock Holmes. But he was much more than that. Apart from being a popular and prolific author – his literary  output included historical novels, science fiction and histories of the Boer War and the First World War – his passion for a wide range of subjects make him a colourful and fascinating character in his own right. He was an early champion of the Channel Tunnel, he played cricket for the MCC, was a staunch advocate of Spiritualism, introduced cross country skiing to Switzerland and he was acquainted with many of the notable public figures of the late Victorian and Edwardian period. His fascinating account of his life is a wonderful record of a unique individual. This volume has the added bonus of a perceptive and illuminating introduction by David Stuart Davies who throws some light into the darker areas of Conan Doyle’s life.</Text>

			<Text>Sketches by Boz was Charles Dickens’ first book, published in 1836 when he was twenty-four. It contains a series of papers written by the author dating from as early as 1833, many of which had been originally published in magazines and periodicals under the pen-name ‘Boz’. This single volume drew together a rich selection of sketches and short tales, recording Dickens’ impressions of life on the teeming streets of Victorian London. He intended it to be ‘illustrative of everyday life and every-day people’, and Dickens’ creativity, coupled with his knack for minute observation, produced a work that was truly the starting point for his successful career as a writer of fiction. Sketches gives a glimpse of the genius that was to develop in Dickens’ later works; complete with the colourful characters, surreal humour and comic invention that was to become so characteristic of his literary style. &lt;&lt; THE AUTHOR Charles Dickens (1812-1870) was arguably Victorian England’s greatest writer, achieving enduring popularity and acclaim for his colourful story-telling and memorable characters. His novels were, among other things, works of social commentary, characterised by empathy for the common man, and censure for the social ills that plagued Victorian society.</Text>

			<Text>Hogarth, France and British Art is a radical reappraisal of the art and achievement of William Hogarth (1697-1764). Hogarth has long been viewed as an insular and chauvinistic individual, with a particular aversion to all things French. On the contrary, while Hogarth himself liked to project this image, his effective invention of British art was founded upon a profound knowledge of contemporary French art and theory. This lavishly illustrated book conjures up in great detail the French and wider European context within which Hogarth's art was formed. The author examines the ways in which Hogarth interacted with and influenced his contemporaries not only in painting and print-making, but also in sculpture, poetry, the novel, the theatre, public life, art education, copyright law, music, and opera. In this wide-ranging but richly detailed book, full of analyses of individual works, Robin Simon draws upon a mass of new material, with fresh considerations of Hogarth's most famous and less well-known works alike, opening a window on to one of the most creative and formative periods in British life. 80 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>16 colour pages           Barrie Meyer has had a lifetime in professional sport, as a cricketer with Gloucestershire, a footballer with Bristol Rovers and Bristol City, and twenty-five years as a first-class and Test match umpire. He made his debut in League football aged eighteen and had many memorable moments as a footballer including as a member of the Rovers side that beat Manchester United in the 1956 FA Cup. Spending his summer months working on Gloucestershire CCC's ground staff, Barrie began keeping wicket for the county in the late 1950s and his steady, reliable performances kept him as their first choice for over a decade. Joining the first-class umpires list in 1972, he soon became one of the most respected officials in the game, standing in the 1979 and 1983 World Cup Finals and in twenty-six Tests, including Ian Botham's famous mauling of the Australians at Teadingly in 1981. In this, his autobiography, Barrie reflects on his extraordinary career in sport. With a supporting cast including cricket legends such as Botham, Viv Richards, Dickie Bird and Curtly Ambrose, it offers a unique perspective on cricket in the 1970s, '80s and '90s and will fascinate anyone interested in the game. Also covering his earlier years as a footballer and cricketer, as well as his more recent work on umpire development in South Africa, this book tells the story of a top sportsman who made the most of his talents.</Text>

			<Text>Most businessmen and women could not survive the corporate world without knowing certain words like antitrust, profit sharing, and stakeholder. Business Words You Should Know is an easy to use, easy to understand guide for anyone who needs to know the language of business and refer to it quickly. Set up in dictionary style, Business Words You Should Know gives clear definitions of common words and phrases used in corporate America, followed by a sentence showing how the idea would be used in practice. No definition requires crossreferencing more than one other concept in order to understand the original word clearly. The appendices include a guide of acronyms and a concepts section that help tie some of the more intertwined ideas together. Business Words You Should Know is the ultimate guide for learning the language of business. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: H. Dean McKay, Ph.D. (Tahoe City, CA), has more than 40 years of experience in operations management, strategic planning, technology development, mergers and acquisitions, and business consulting by providing vision and leadership advice to CEOs, presidents, and key executives in a wide range of industries. He is an experienced strategic focus facilitator, having conducted more than 400 corporate and multi-firm sessions designed to create value in private, publicly traded companies and non-profit organizations. P.T. Shank (Worcester, MA) is the author of Test Words You Should Know, as well as two forthcoming works of fiction.</Text>

			<Text>Cooper Lawrence has appeared on Today, CNN’s Showbiz Tonight, The Insider, Fox News, and The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch • Her dating advice has been featured in the New York Daily News, the New York Post, the Chicago Tribune, InStyle, Complete Woman, Cosmopolitan, and Star. &lt;&lt; Women the world over waste too much time trying to turn unchangeable men into great boyfriends. With The Fixer-Upper Man, psychologist Cooper Lawrence shows readers how to change the ones worth keeping, and get over those who aren’t. More important, she teaches them how to differentiate between a Fixer Upper and a Money Pit, to grab onto the former, and to run screaming from the latter. Is he… • Smart and talented but underemployed? • Cute under all that hair and buff under all those baggy pants? • Nice but a tad, uh, boring? The best part about Lawrence’s tips is that they can be carried out with such finesse that a Fixer Upper won’t even know what’s happening to him. He’ll go from good to great in no time.      AUTHOR: Cooper Lawrence (New York, NY) is a psychologist, radio personality, and television expert. Her nationally syndicated radio talk show, The Cooper Lawrence Show, is smart talk about real life. The author of Been There, Done That, Kept the Jewelry, she is also an advisory board member for CosmoGIRL! magazine, for which she writes a regular column.</Text>

			<Text>At three in the morning when Baby’s nursing for the fourth time in four hours, and a weary new mom has to read something with her free hand (or risk falling asleep and dropping the baby), Breastfeeding Sucks is the only book that will do. Inside, Joanne Kimes covers: • Preparing for breastfeeding before the birth • Coping with physical and emotional challenges that face both mother and newborn • Nursing in public and pumping at the office • Weaning that little tot before his eighth birthday In the hilarious, real-mom style that made her Pregnancy Sucks a hit, Kimes lays it all out and gives as much mitigating advice as she can muster to reduce the nipple pain, fatigue, and frustration that comes with breastfeeding. Breastfeeding Sucks is the only book a nursing mom needs on the way to sippy cups.     AUTHOR: Joanne Kimes (Studio City, CA) is the coauthor of Potty Training Sucks and the bestselling Pregnancy Sucks. She has written for a number of children’s and comedy television shows.

			<Text>This handy-sized guide is drawn from the extensively revised edition of Jackson's Silver and Gold Marks of England, Scotland and Ireland, published by the Antique Collectors' Club in 1989. Ever since its publication in 1905, English Goldsmiths and Their Marks, or Jackson's, has been the bible for scholars, dealers and collectors, selling in hundreds of thousands. The Antique Collectors' Club revised edition contains approximately 15,000 marks, with over 10,000 corrections to the second edition published in 1921. This pocket edition contains complete cycles of silver marks for all the important Assay Offices, with variations shown for gold, platinum, Britannia Standard, import marks, etc., and has been updated to 1991 to include current assay marks. The Pocket Edition of Jackson's Hallmarks contains 1,000 makers' marks listed alphabetically by mark, with comments as to rarity, value and the speciality of the maker (e.g. spoons), making it the best available pocket guide to hallmarks. Other small guides to hallmarks based on outdated information have been rendered obsolete by this pocket edition, which is the most accurate, complete and up to date guide on the market.       Ian Pickford was born and educated in London and is a Freeman of both the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths and the City of London.  He is the author of Silver Flatware: English, Irish and Scottish, 1660-1980, and editor of Jackson's Silver and Gold Marks of England, Scotland and Ireland, both published by the Antique Collectors' Club.  He lectures extensively for NADFAS (National Association of Decorative and Fine Art Societies) and is a popular member of the television Antiques Roadshow team.</Text>

			<Text>Very readable account of the faithful restoration of a Gertrude Jekyll Garden, working to the original plans   Of interest to gardeners, and garden history and design enthusiasts   Filled with practical advice learnt from experience   Fully illustrated with pictures chronicling the restoration process   First edition sold out within two months   The garden at the Manor House, Upton Grey in Hampshire, England, was designed by Gertrude Jekyll for Charles Holme, the founder of 'The Studio'. Having fallen into disrepair it has been accurately and painstakingly recreated over a period of sixteen years to embody Gertrude Jekyll's original vision. It now contains the only fully restored Jekyll wild garden still in existence.  The recreation was made possible by the discovery of Jekyll's original plans at the Reef Point Collection in the United States, secured for posterity by the great American landscape architect Beatrix Farrand. Rosamund Wallinger, the current owner of the Manor House, personally undertook the restoration of this Edwardian masterpiece.  Meticulous records and photographs kept throughout the restoration have enabled Rosamund Wallinger to produce a beautifully illustrated and historic document. Full of fascinating horticultural details, and tinged with a very necessary sense of humour, her account makes fascinating reading for anyone with an interest in garden design and garden history.  The lessons learnt in the course of restoration will be a source of inspiration and practical advice to anyone undertaking a similar project on a smaller scale, as well as being a fascinating insight into the methods of Gertrude Jekyll.     Rosamund Wallinger acquired her gardening skills as a result of the challenges of garden restoration and throughout their horticultural adventure she has been supported and encouraged by numerous friends in the gardening world. The garden has appeared on many television programmes. Rosamund Wallinger lectures regularly in the United States and visitors come to see the garden from around the world.      300 col. 16b/w</Text>

			<Text>When i started, thirty-two years ago, I had nothing at all. Not even a car. By working hard and surrounding myself with the right kind of people, my business could grow into what it is now. Today I can count on more than 1100 people who take the interests of the company to heart in thirty-six establishments av=cross the world. I am very proud of this spirit and I am very grateful indeed foe their dedication.&lt;&lt; Closer to home, in Brasschaat, I discovered a chateau. As a small boy i dreamt of owning a castle one day. Not to live in, but to be able to invite guests to a banquet in its elegant rooms. Delicious food is a passion of mine, and so I developed the idea of establishing an attractive and refined restaurant in this beautiful chateau, supported by the best professionals in the business. This is how Kesteel Withof became a fascianting project which soon began to take shape, thanks to a young, energetic, creative and talented team. Apart from the restaurant, we created a lounge bar, six stylish hotel rooms, a unique wine cellar and a state-of-the-art kitchen, where the best chefs are given full scope to develop their talents and prove themselves. &lt;&lt; Together with this dedicated team I have been able to make something beautiful evolve in Kasteel Withof. This is a place where gourmets and epicureans, and even the most culinary experienced sybaritic connoisseurs, will be eager to return to. The dream of a naive boy has been fulfilled. This splendid book aspires to be a tangible reflection of a dream come true. &lt;&lt;    Colour photos throughout</Text>

			<Text>Today surrealism may be firstly known as a school in literature and fine arts, but the influence of this 20th century school on other domains cannot be underestimated. The world of contemporary design doesn't escape a healthy portion of surreal humour. Forms with a Smile bundles desigs and objects of modern surrealists and shows that nothing is what it seeems to be. &lt;&lt; Hairy carpets, lamps in the shape of a milk bottle, USB sticks cut from wood branches or chairs made from plush toys. Is it just humour? Or is it a stimulating statement wrapped in a contagious smile? Just like surrealsim, design sometimes tells more than we think. Armed with subtle irony these new surrealists wage war against a world reigned by a certain serieux. &lt;&lt; Text in English and Dutch              300 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Portrait art of Holland's Golden Age is one of the most fascinating phenomena in the history of Western art, distinguished  by a powerful realism, an immense diversity and , above all, a high artistic level. The National Gallewry in London and the Mauritshuis in The Hague are mounting a majotr exhibition on the subject in 2007. The main thread  running through the exhibition is the chronological development of the portrait, militia and regents portraits as well as children's portraits. Within each theme a selection of works are being shown which offer imposing and also exciting juxtapositions. &lt;&lt; In this accessible publication all the exhibited paintings are illustrated in colour and have accompanying information. The texts are prefaced by three lavishly illustrated essays on the development of portraiture in the northern part of the Netherlands and the costumes worn in portraits.&lt;&lt; 150 colour &amp; 40 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>"I am a liar," thought Max dreamily forking the antipasto which had arrived brought by a waiter with an apologetic and furtive air. "I knew liws before I knew sex, before I knew money. I am married to lies. And I shall stay married. I have made too many promises to do anything else. "But Max has told too many lies, and he is beginning to lose his nerve. He thinks he has lost control but where? Has it happened in New York, Saint Petersburgh, London, Buenos Aires, or here in Rome? Who wants to betray this charismatic gargoyle of a man with his alluring chatter and solid presence which make up for his size? Max knows the answer: too many. &lt;&lt; The story of Max is told by Rachel. Max is fictitious and it is the Max trilogy which made Rachel rich until she lost everything. Now lying in bed, like Sheherazade in The Thousand and One Nights, she is telling the story of Max, as well as her own story which is also the story of Tina Faithful and le Comte de Braband; a story of love, death and  betrayal. The Dream Maker is a dark comedy, rich in ambiguity, in which nothing is quitw what it seems. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Mikka Haugaard was born in Denmark in 1953. Her fatehr is Danish and her mother American and she grew up bilingual. She studied classics at Cambridge University and did research in Roman history. She now teaches classics and psychology at a Londin school and lectures for the Open University. She is married with two children. Dedalus published her first novel Gabriel's Burreau, a dark, fast moving thriller in 2005. &lt;&lt;REVIEWS: "Haugaard has a vivid and quirky imagination".  S.B. Kelly in Scotland on Sunday &lt;&lt;&lt; "A talented and really interesting writer."  Jill Paton Walsh.</Text>

			<Text>Is there such a thing as a unique “Zürich photography”? Is it possible that a photographic viewpoint can develop from a particular place that distinguishes itself from the rest of contemporary photography? Published to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Zürich School of Art and Design’s photography department, Photography, Made in Zürich documents how the illustrious program forged a niche in the international art world and cultivated Switzerland’s foremost photographers, including internationally renowned artists such as Werner Bischof, René Burri, and Ernst Scheidegger.   This lavishly illustrated volume reproduces the work of over forty students from the past two decades, including such young stars as Olaf Breuning and Shirana Shahbazi. Their photographs are accompanied by essays that probe the unconventional atmosphere and avant-garde teaching philosophies that helped establish the Zürich School’s creative reputation. Photography, Made in Zürich will delight all followers of twentieth-century photography and the electrifying world of contemporary art. About the Author Thomas Weski is chief curator at the Haus der Kunst, Munich. Previously the chief curator at the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, he has curated over eighty photography exhibitions, including Cruel and Tender at the Tate Modern in London in 2003. 242 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Ernst Kirchner, seminal expressionist painter and founding member of the influential artists’ collective Die Brücke, came to the Swiss mountains during World War I to recuperate from a nervous breakdown. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and his Friends is the first book to explore how Kirchner became a role model, teacher, and mentor for younger artists during his time in Davos.  The momentous artistic exchange between Kirchner and his young admirers—whose ranks included the German Philipp Bauknecht, the Dutch Jan Wiegers, and the members of the Swiss Gruppe Rot-Blau—established a dialogue that had a formative influence on the direction of European art in the twentieth century. This matchless volume provides a record of the extraordinary bond that developed between a legendary—yet ailing—artist and the up-and-coming Gruppe Rot-Blaue in Switzerland.   About the Author  Beat Stutzer is director of the Bündner Kunstmuseum Chur (Museum of Art of the Grisons) in Chur, Switzerland, and a curator at the Segantini Museum in St. Mortiz, Switzerland. Samuel Vitali is a curator at the Museum of Fine Arts, Bern, Switzerland. Han Steenbruggen is a curator of twentieth-century art at the Groninger Museum, the Netherlands. Matthias Frehner is director of the Museum of Fine Arts in Bern, Switzerland. 234 colour &amp; 108 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Sculptors have long been fascinated, even seduced, by the possibilities of the human body. From classical Greece’s Doryphoros to Michelangelo’s David, the nude has captivated artists and viewers alike with its simplicity and power. One of the most arresting interpreters of the human form is Alberto Giacometti (1901–66), renowned for haunting nudes so prophetic for the moderns that they were claimed by the surrealist, existentialist, formalist, and expressionist movements in turn. Now, intensely personal photographs of Giacometti’s work are available for the first time in print in Ernst Scheidegger’s Alberto Giacometti: Sculpture in Plaster. Alongside personal commentary documenting his twenty-year friendship with the sculptor, Scheidegger here presents photographs he took at Giacometti’s Paris studio and family home in Switzerland. These striking images document Giacometti’s little-seen work in plaster, the intermediate stage of his artistic process before the final bronze casting. They vividly evoke how the sculptor worked and offer unique insight into Giacometti’s creative process.  The images are accompanied by curator Christian Klemm’s critical essay on the sculptor who revolutionized the art world and entranced a 1930s Parisian milieu that included Joan Miró, Pablo Picasso, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Giacometti’s later razor-thin, skeletal nudes, Klemm argues, reflect the devastation of postwar Europe and the angst of a generation. This rich collection of photographs provides a surprising new perspective on the way that Giacometti gave his artistic vision physical form.  114 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Known as the “King of the Air,” the Swiss balloonist Eduard Spelterini (1852–1931) enchanted the imaginations of European royalty, military generals, wealthy patrons, and the public alike with his mastery of the most whimsical mode of travel ever invented—the gas balloon. During the course of his storied aviation career, Spelterini flew his balloons over the Swiss Alps, across the Egyptian pyramids, and past the ziggurats of the Middle East, taking breathtaking photographs of landscapes and cities from the sky.   On Spelterini’s first ballooning ventures, he ferried aristocrats between Vienna, Bucharest, Athens, and other European capitals, on flights that became so famous that they were soon jam-packed with an international press corps looking for the next sensational story. Later in his life, Spelterini was the first aeronaut to succeed in the hazardous passage over the Swiss Alps, a trip then thought impossible. Eventually, he decided to bring his camera on every voyage in order to document the full panorama of international vistas he encountered.  Eduard Spelterini—Photographs of A Pioneer Balloonist is the first book after 80 years to present these images of his journeys, reproduced directly from the artist’s original glass negatives. Contextualized by essays that explore both Spelterini’s life and his photographic work, the photographs featured in this volume capture the heady mix of danger and discovery that defined the early years of international air travel when balloons ruled the skies.  120 b/w illustrations TEXT IN GERMAN AND ENGLISH</Text>

			<Text>This catalogue of Books of Hours, the 'bestseller' of the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, presents two dozen Books of Hours mostly dating from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Examples from France, the Netherlands, and Belgium are presented chronologically with illustrations in colour for each entry. Highlights include a fine early Dutch Book of Hours with illuminations closely related to those by the artists of the Utrecht History Bibles (active c.1430-45). There is also a lavish Book of Hours signed with marks by one of the Masters of Otto von Mordrecht; and a high qaulity Parisian Book of Hours with an unusual sequence of miniatures by the Master Jacques de Besancon. Many of these Books of Hours are previously entirely unknown and unpublished. An introductory essay explores how illuminated Books of Hours encouraged their readers to picture piety through reading of texts accompanied by visual aids. &lt;&lt; 50 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>This catalogue presents 35 medieval and Renaissance rings, from a private collection, which represent fine examples of most of the major types of rings created during this period in Western Europe and Byzantium. Most extant publications on rings focus on the archaeological, antiquarian and/or socio-historical context of rings. The contribution of this book, in addition to making known a choice privately held collection of high-quality rings, lies in its art historical observations. For example, did you know that the origin of the medieval stirrup rings coincides with the origin of the Gothic arch, whose form it shares? That the Gothic iconofraphic ring can be compared with the illuminations illustrating the suffrages in medieval Books of Hours? Or that the Merovingian architectural rings, replicating the forms of Early Christian baptisteries, amy have been worn by women converts to Christianity? These, and many other art-historical observations, are found in this unique book. &lt;&lt; 125 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>The Swiss painter Fe lix Vallotton (1865- 1925) and his artworks were uniquely poised to embrace both the dawn of modernism and the fading light of the post-impressionist and symbolist movements. Lavishly illustrated, "Fe lix Vallotton" traces the artist' s life from his early days as a portraitist and printmaker to his later work as painter who prefigured European modernism. Linda Scha dler and Christoph Becker reveal Valloton to be not only the most important Swiss symbolist, but an intelligent observer of his tumultuous times, highly critical of bourgeois convention. His sometimes eerie naturalism, the authors argue, links him to literary fashions of the day as well as reflecting the inception of psychoanalysis. This stunning volume forges a new understanding of landmark paintings from an especially fertile period in art history and the fascinating artist behind them.   &lt;&lt; 120 colour &amp; 30 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Celebrated opera singer José Cura sings regularly on the world’s great stages, from the Met and the Lyric Opera to Covent Garden and La Scala. But in addition to his prolific career as a tenor, conductor, composer, and mentor to young singers, Cura is also a gifted photographer. Espontáneas is the first book to present his captivating images to the public.  The more than ninety photographs featured here document Cura’s considerable travels around the world, as well as the people he encountered along the way. The countenances captured by his lens reflect the full gamut of the human condition: dignity, poverty, old age, and loneliness.  Accompanied by descriptions written by Cura and other authors, this volume presents a panorama of faces seen through the eyes of an extraordinary talent. About the Author José Cura is an internationally renowned opera singer, conductor, and composer who has been an avid photographer for many years.  95 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Counting calories can be confusing. So can fad diets. And the cost of those premade diet meals can really add up. Anyone following a national weight loss program doesn’t need to stress anymore about counting calories—or sacrificing flavor—with recipes for delicious foods like: • Banana Chocolate Chip Waffle Wrap • Honey and Cheese Stuffed Figs • Spinach, Crab, and Artichoke Dip • Creamy Potato Soup • Beef Fondue • Chili-Crusted Sea Scallops • Tomato and Tarragon Sole • Chicken and Green Bean Casserole • Salads, sandwiches, wraps, and pasta dishes Based on a 1,200 calorie a day diet, readers can plan their meals for the day, week, or even month, while being able to mix ‘n match recipes for any time of the year.&lt;&lt;AUTHOR:Paula Conwy (Westport, CT) is the former food critic for the New York Resident. She has written about healthy living and mind/body detox programs for Good Housekeeping and she has written about food for the New York Times. She is the author of two weight loss books, The Disney Diet, which was conceived after she lost five pounds on a 5-day vacation at Walt Disney World, and I Am Not a Cook Book: The Cook Book for Time-Starved Over-Achievers. Brierley E. Wright, R.D. (Cambridge, MA), is a registered dietician with several years of kitchen and food service work experience. A graduate of the University of Vermont, she obtained her registered dietician certificate before pursuing a masters degree in Nutrition Communication at Tufts University’s Friedman School of Nutrition and Science Policy.</Text>

			<Text>This is the first book that gives brides what they really need: solutions to the problems other people cause • Features diplomatic scripts for brides to follow when confronting difficult friends and family as well as sidebars on how to keep the peace • Author Sharon Naylor’s wedding books have sold more than 250,000 copies • Perfect for wedding promotions &lt;&lt; What bride hasn’t faced one (if not each) of the following? • “We’re planning the wedding with both sets of parents, but the mothers are feuding over everything. Should we ‘fire’ them?” • “Several of our long-distance relatives have written us about the wedding, and we weren’t planning on inviting them. How can we break the news?” • “We’ve received several response cards where guests wrote in that they’re bringing their kids. Should we fight it or just plan a kids’ table?” Wedding stress comes not only from big budgets and big to-do lists, but also from the universal phenomenon that the people around the bride and groom seem to lose all sense of decorum. The Bride’s Diplomacy Guide offers pensive brides and grooms real-life, action-step scenarios that give them actual dialogue to confront and manage these sticky and sometimes relationshipcrushing scenarios. It’s the book couples need to preserve their relationships, long after they say “I do.”&lt;&lt;AUTHOR:Sharon Naylor (Madison, NJ) has been named “The Most Prolific Wedding Author in the Country.” She’s appeared on Inside Edition, ABC News, Fox 5 News, Nightline, and Lifetime, and was recently invited to guest on a wedding special for NBC, Bravo, and iVillage.

A welcome alternative to online dating, 1001 Ways to Meet Mr. Right proves that men really are everywhere just waiting to be met—and can be found in the unlikeliest of places: • Riding the bus • Learning to sail • Joining Mensa • Volunteering at an animal shelter • Becoming a tour guide at a local attraction • Attending a wine tasting night • Keeping an eye out while pumping gas With helpful lists of the best specific locations in the United States to meet members of the opposite sex, the pros and cons of meeting men in these places, and real first-person anecdotes from women who’ve met their mates, readers will gain confidence that they don’t have to look very far. Their future plus-one could be as close as a few seats away on the subway or a few paces behind them in line at the movies. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR:       Elizabeth Shimer (Philadelphia, PA) is a freelance writer who specializes in women’s health and women’s issues. She has written three other books, most recently The Wedding Gown Book. In addition, she has written dozens of magazine articles and contributed to numerous books on the topics of psychology, health and wellness, travel, and fashion.

It was the year 1929: Walter P.Chrysler was applying the finishing touches in his eponymous building. John JAcob RAskob broke ground on the Empire State Building, and uptown on East 76th street, amidst both farm houses and townhouses, rose a haven for high society, artists, royalty, and world leaders. &lt;&lt; Since its inception, the Carlyle has personified timeless traditions and the elegance and sophistication that define the history of its surrounding neighbourhood. Its values are art and culture, and the hotel fuses seamlessly with the museums and galleries amidst: from Lufvig Bemelman's colourful murals which decorate its bar, or the sounds of bygone masters from Richard Rodgers to George Gershwin, and of course the inimitable Bobby Short, whose music resonated for decades inside hotel suites and the legendary Cafe Carlyle. It is a haven where the old world charms of personal service and mastery of details are delicately maintained, where the legendary decor originally designed by decoratrix extraordinaire Dorothy Drapewr resonates alingside the innovations by contemporary master Thierry Despont. In this remarkably illustrated and carefully researched commemorative volume, all of these legends come alive, a befitting chronicle of one of New York City's most unforgettable destinations. &lt;&lt; 150 illustrations</Text>

Inspired Styles in an anthology of ideas, creative palettes, and selected works by fifteen interior designers, who have all created textile collections for the Kravet and Lee Jofa Fabrics and Furnishings Company. Each designer reveals his tastes, inspirations, and artistic approaches and invites readers to better understand his or her creative process, opening the doors to every new possibility. Filled with vibrant photographs that combine inspiration with completed decor, enriched with texts penned by the designers themselves, and a forword by House and Garden's editor-in-chief, Dominique Browning, Inspired Styles is a reference for amateurs and professionals alike, who are curious, ecclectic and want the most from interior design.</Text>

			<Text>Ferrari’s fifty-year Formula 1 history is made up of ups and downs, of memorable exploits and bitter disappointments, of exciting chapters and long periods of decline. It has little relevance however because  Ferrari is, quite simply, the essence of F1 itself. It is the only team in F1 to have taken part in every edition of the world championship from 1950 to the present day. It is the team that has won the most GPs, the most Drivers’ and Constructors’ titles. Ferrari represents the past and the present of the category that is rightly considered to be the pinnacle of competitive motor sport. It is the witness to a historical and sporting manifestation that neither time nor events have altered. It is because Ferrari is Ferrari, it is a legend that grows and is celebrated every season that passes, after each victory conquered by the men in the end.  This book documents in pictures and brief text the Ferrari Formula 1 story from 1948 – 2007.  Paolo d’Alessio was born in the province of Turin in 1957 and became involved in motorsport in 1978. His articles, together with his detailed cutaway designs, are published in the leading specialized magazines and sports daily newspapers throughout the world. He has authored several books and from 1986 to 1994 he was responsible for the international yearbook 365 Racing Days, and starting in 1995 the special yearbook on Formula 1 published by SEP Editrice, which has become the most well-known and widespread book on Formula 1 throughout the world.</Text>

			<Text>The biblical idea of a distinct 'Jewish contribution to civilization' continues to engage Jews and on-Jews alike. This book seeks neither to document nor to discredit the notion, but rather ti investigate the idea itself as it has been understood from the seventeeth century to the present. It explores that role the concept has played in Jewish self-definition, how it has influenced the political, social, and cultural history of the Jews and of others, and wether discussion of the notion still has relevance in the world today. &lt;&lt; The book offers a broad spectrum of academic opinion: from tempered advocacy to reasoned disavowal , with many alternative variations on the theme in between. It attempts to illustrate the centraqlity of the question in modern Jewish culture in general, and its importance for modern Jewish studies in particular.&lt;&lt;AUTHORS: Jeremy Cohen holds the Abraham and Edita Spiegel Family Foundation Chair for European Jewish History at Tel Aviv University, where he served as Director of the Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center between 2002 and 2005. A specialist in the history of Jewish-Christian relations and three times a winner of the National Jewish Book Award.                 Richard I. Cohen holds the Paulette and Claude Kelman Chair in French Jewish Studies and has served as the Academic Head of Revivim, the honours programme at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem for the training of Jewish studies teachers.</Text>

			<Text>The photographic image is key to the public's perception of world leaders and film stars alike. Yet this stunning new book exposes the ways in which the images of some of the best-known men and women of the modern age have been created, manipulated and sold. Accompanying a major BBC Two ten-part series, The World's Most Photographed focuses on Greta Garbo, Mahatma Gandhi, John F. Kennedy, Queen Victoria, Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, James Dean, Muhammad Ali and Adolf Hitler, and exposes a new side to each individual through rare and unfamiliar photographs. Robin Muir, a leading writer on photography, reveals how each individual created, altered and reinvented their public persona through their photographic image. In each of the ten chapters, he: Re-tells the life-story of one of the world's most famous individuals, through the creation of their image in photography and archive. Tells the tales behind the photos, from famous or forgotten shoots to the stories of lucky photography amateurs. Demonstrates how key photographs were produced, highlighting the development of important photographic styles and techniques. Tracks down unfamiliar images of these individuals to reveal sides of their personalities, which they or their advisers preferred to conceal. Illustrated with 150 stunning photographs. The World's Most Photographed accompanies a major BBC series and a BBC online photographic gallery.</Text>

			<Text>One of Britain’s top naval historians takes on a previously unexplored area of Churchill’s wartime efforts in this much anticipated follow on to a successful study last year of Churchill’s navy. Entirely original in his approach, Lavery considers the practicalities of transporting a prime minister through dangerous skies and across hostile oceans in a time of global war. Readers learn that like most of the British war effort, Churchill’s voyages were under-planned and improvised. The many firsthand accounts that are included offer an intimate portrait of the man through the eyes of his traveling companions, ministers and top military officers, and secretaries and typists, as well as the ship and aircraft crews responsible for his safety. The book concludes with an examination of the legacy of the voyages, especially with regard to air travel and developing world statesmanship.&lt;&lt;40 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>David Brown takes a detailed look at the Allied ships, weapons, and tactics that won the submarine war in the Atlantic in this handsomely illustrated book. Beginning with the lessons learned from World War I, the author outlines inter-war developments in technology and training and describes preparations for World War II. For defending navies, the prime requirement was numbers, and Brown explains that the most pressing problem was to improve capability without sacrificing simplicity and speed of construction. The author’s analyses of the resulting designs of sloops, frigates, corvettes, and destroyer escorts and his determination of their relative effectiveness offer insights new even to those well versed on the subject of anti-submarine warfare during the Atlantic War.    200 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>David Owen presents an authoritative yet highly readable account of the ongoing battle between naval forces above and below the sea’s surface. Without question, the submarine was the most potent purely naval weapon of the twentieth century, yet the fact that it was usually defeated is an important part of the story described in this book. The author examines both the successful innovations and the inevitable countermeasures made by each side in their lethal struggle for supremacy. Concluding the book is a survey of recent ASW developments carried out by teams of scientists, engineers, commanders, and crews of ASW aircraft, ships, and other submarines working together to defeat the current threat of hostile raiders who hide in the ocean depths.         190 photos and line drawings</Text>

			<Text>Step-by-step, this ship modeler’s manual explains how to build a 1/16th scale model of the American privateer schooner Prince de Neufchatel. One of a new class of large, fast, and seaworthy schooners that first appeared in the War of 1812, the ship had a short but notoriously successful career that earned a permanent place in U.S. history. Written by the world-renowned ship modeler Phillip Reed, the book explains how to build two versions of the schooner: a waterline model and a full-hull display model. Beautifully illustrated with hundreds of color photographs, the guide passes along a wealth of information that Reed has learned over the years.&lt;&lt;200 colour photos</Text>

			<Text>On this speck of volcanic soil in the middle of a vast sea, a complete, unique and peaceful world was created slowly and carefully. It waited there for hundreds of thousands of years for an annihilating invasion of voracious animals for which it was totally unprepared, a cohort of rapacious beasts led by the worst predator in the world, Homo sapiens...In an incredibly short space of time, a number of unique species had vanished...Mauritius, the green and mountainous island in the Indian Ocean that was once the home of the ill-fated dodo, still had among its fauna many unique but endangered species, among them Mauritius kestrels, Telfair's skinks, Gunther's geckos and pink pigeons. The indigenous flora and fauna of Mauritius were, by the 1970s, hanging onto their existence by their fingernails.When Gerald Durrell went to rescue some of these creatures from extinction, he experienced danger and discomfort, but enjoyed the adventures greatly. By the end of his trip, he had an extraordinary collection of animals to take to his Jersey sanctuary from where the progeny could, in time, be restored to Mauritius.</Text>

			<Text>Very few people, Italians included, get to experience the real Venice. The sinking city has been mythologised in history, art, literature and music for centuries, but memoirs and stories tend to resonate with cliches of its high aestheticism, the pleasures of the good life and the contrastingly dark underbelly of vendettas and crimes of passion.During two long, humid summers, Bidisha, a young writer from London, set out to explore the truth of the revered City of Love. She was guided through its intricate social conventions by her best friend's family, as characterful and regal as anything Henry James could invent, who have been established in one of the most famous palazzi on the Canal Grande since making their fortune importing glass beads in the seventeenth century. While learning valuable lessons about the easygoing rhythm of 'the Italian way', Bidisha also glimpsed the coldness and disturbing prejudices that exist close beneath the sophisticated surface of this stylish place." Venetian Masters" is a witty portrait of a family and a slice-of-life observation of a city where the police officers look like male models, vicious public arguments flare up over the behaviour of pet dogs and the theft of a bottle of champagne from a pavilion at the Art Biennale constitutes the greatest crime wave of the last five years.   &lt;&lt;  AUTHOR: Bidisha was born in 1978, has been writing since the age of 15 and at 16 signed her first book deal for her novel, Seahorses. In 2000 she published her second novel, Too Fast to Live.</Text>

			<Text>Real Villain's tales from the bad, the mad and the dangerous to know.  Police officers are now no longer encouraged to talk to criminals, and that's a pity.  Wonderful stories once were shared as a result of a quick pint with a snout down the pub, or as a respite during interrogation, when both copper and criminal would stop for a fag. Those were the glory days, where gripping accounts of slashings, fit-ups, dodgy deals, blaggings and petermen would filter through and become folklore. These days such intimacy is frowned upon (and smoking in interrogation cells is of course banned) so it is only here that these stories can be recounted.  In "Villains' Tales" the reader will be introduced to the bad, the mad and the dangerous to know, recounted in gripping style by those who had intimate dealings with the shady characters, both criminal and copper, from London's underworld, long ago.  All the usual suspects are here - the Krays, the Richardsons, plus a few surprises and several hidden gems. Literally.   AUTHOR: Dick Kirby served in the Flying Squad and the Serious Crimes Squad before medical discharge in 1993. He lives in Suffolk, where he takes life more leisuerly.  SALES POINTS *Another fantastic dose of true crim from the author of The Real Sweeney and You're Nicked  REVIEWS * 'Dick Kirby lifts the veil to expose a unique crime fighting unit.' John O'Connor, Former Commander, Flying Squad * 'Well written and entertaining' Michael Winner * 'A page-turning experience to remember.' Joseph Waembaugh author of The Choirboys *It's full of dark humour, tense bursts and standoffs, with lunatics on both sides. Daily Sport</Text>

			<Text>Even more scurrilous than 'Rome', A Brief History of the Private Lives of the Roman Emperors tells the true story of toga parties, banquets and the scandalous life of the Caesars. Ancient history with all the boring bits taken out.  With the recent success of 'Rome' on BB2, no one will look at the private lives of the Roman Emperors again in the same light. Anthony Blond's scandalous expose of the life of the Caesars is a must-read for all interested in what really went on in ancient Rome. Julius Caesar is usually presented as a glorious general when in fact he was an arrogant charmer and a swank; Augustus was so conscious of his height that he put lifts in his sandals. But they were nothing compared to Caligula, Claudius and Nero. This book is fascinating reading, eye-opening in its revelations and effortlessly entertaining.   >>AUTHOR: Former publisher Anthony Blond is the author of numerous books including The World of Simon Raven and his autobigraphy Jew Made in England. He regularly writes for the Spectator and the Literary Review.  &lt;&lt;REVIEW: 'The sort of book that gives history a good name'.  Sunday Telegraph  &lt;&lt; 'Informative, fun'. TLS &lt;&lt; 'Lively and amusing - the Emperors enjoyably monstrous.'  Observer SALES POINTS The true history behind BBC 2's Rome A wonderfully entertaining reissue of a classic</Text>

The user-friendly, step-by-step approach explains why they worry, how to recognise what feeds it and develop effective methods of dealing with it.

			<Text>During the dark, grey days of early December Agatha is obsessed by only two things - Christmas, and her ex, James Lacey. Although she says she feels nothing for James now, she feels sure that planning the perfect Dickensian Christmas for all her friends will somehow reanimate her love.Even the murder of a Mrs Tamworthy, poisoned with hemlock at the local manor house, does little to distract Agatha from organising her perfect yuletide celebrations. And yet it should do, as Mrs Tamworthy had written to Agatha, telling her that one of her family wanted to see her dead before the year was out.Slightly guiltily (and belatedly), Agatha sets out to solve the case with the help of her new recruit, young Toni Gilmour.  &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: M.C. Beaton worked as a Fleet Street journalist. She is the author of 18 Agatha Raisin novels, the Hamish Mcbeth series, and an Edwardian murder-mystery series. She divides her time between Paris and the Cotswolds, where she lives in a village very much like Agatha's beloved Carsely.</Text>

			<Text>Forever fascinated by canes, the author has always collected them-he even has his grandma's and grandpa's walking sticks. And, as a professional woodcarver, he knows there's a good market for them. Walking sticks come in three basic categories: the cane, which is a walking aid or a gentleman's walking stick; the staff or hiking stick, which is head-high; and the chest-high quarterstaff, which Tom's grandpa used to call a "thunk stick." Each of these types is generously represented among the 86 patterns in this book. Their designs include everything from fish to dragons and birds to beavers. This is a valuable reference book for all carvers.</Text>

			<Text>Discover how peace and tranquility have been tapped through the personal stories of ordinary people, ordinary gardens, and extraordinary spaces. As professional horticulturalists, as husband and wife, and now as authors, Michel and Judy Marcellot explore motivations to garden for peace, for balance, for relaxation, for contemplation, and to memorialize loved ones. Above all, they find joy expressed within and through gardening. Personal stories show how the simple act of gardening changed lives and individuals. The authors chronicle their own paths from naive and idealistic, back-to-the-earth entrepreneurs who wanted to "be of service to the planet, and have a good time doing it," to respected horticulturists and sought after speakers who still embody the same ideals as when they started out. Examples illustrate varied elements of sacred sites and suggest ways readers might create the sacred in their own gardens. Read on and see how ordinary gardeners can attain their own backyard bliss. &lt;, 320 colour photos</Text>

			<Text>A city with the representation of literally hundreds of ethnic groups, Chicago has rightfully earned its nickname as the melting pot of America. The authors of The Great Chicago Melting Pot Cookbook have selected a representative group of these nationalities and, in over 400 recipes, have presented the best of their native cuisine. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of a culture is its cooking and The Great Chicago Melting Pot Cookbook is a delightful way to get acquainted. Over the years, American immigrants have adapted the recipes from their homeland to reflect the tastes and available ingredients of their new country. The recipes found here are easy for the American cook to follow, yet still retain the character of the original cuisine. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Miss Feeney and Mr Leckel have written food articles for Gourmet and Chicago magazines. They are also the authors of The Legendary Illinois Cookbook. Miss Feeney studied drawing and painting in Europe and two of Mr. Leckel's television shows hane been nominated for Emmys. Their artistic ability is reflected in the fine line drawings which add extra dimension to this unique and exciting cookbook. &lt;&lt;Illustrated</Text>

			<Text>162 clear color photos and lively instructions teach readers to create imaginative and colorful Christmas ornaments made from hard-shelled, miniature gourds. The designs include birdhouses, snowmen, angels, tree balls, double tree balls, tree toppers, and wall hangings. Step-by-step instructions proceed from initial gourd cleaning to final painting, wood burning, and the installation of hangers.  Simple tools are required to complete the projects. Advice for growing gourds and a gallery of finished ornaments are provided to fire the reader's imagination to create beautiful handcrafted objects.  AUTHOR: Angela Mohr, GourdGal, lives in Stephens City, Virginia with her husband and son on a lovely piece of property that's part of a subdivision, which proves gourds do not have to be grown on large expanses of land. Her interest in gourds began in earnest more than 15 years ago when her garden produced a hearty bounty. Each design of gourd work inspired another idea and another project. Even after all these years, Anfgela is still coming up with new annual crops of gourd projects to delight students and customers alike. &lt;&lt; Angela is a member of the American Gourd Society and the Guild of American Papercutters. She is currently one of the co-ordinators for the Virginia chapter of the AGS, the Virginia Lovers' Gourd Society, and helps organize the annual Virginia Gourd Festival. Her art is whimsical and makes use of her various skills and interests: gourds, papercutting, collecting quotes and recipes, and generally giving out advice.&lt;&lt;   162 colour photos</Text>

			<Text>This path-breaking study by leading historians of the First World War considers all aspects of command at all levels on the Western Front. Drawing upon am wealth of original material, a mixture of established historians and younger scholars consider such topics as the adjustment to static warfare; the role of GHQ; Hubert Gough’s style of command at Fifth Division; artillery command; and divisional command at Passchendaele. To put it simply: if the British Army really had been led by donkeys and had been as inflexible and incompetent as it has been made out, then how was the war won and how did the Army reach such a peak of military excellence in 1918? Find out in this book.                        THE AUTHOR Dr Gary Sheffield is Senior Lecturer in Defence Studies at King’s College London. He has published many books on military history, including The Somme (2003). Dr Dan Todman is Lecturer in Modern British History at Queen Mary, University of London. Also an author of several books, including The Great War: Myth and Memory. &lt;&lt; 20 mono pictures + 4 maps</Text>

			<Text>The updated edition of the classic bible of American furniture. It presents a thorough analysis, through over 700 photographs and detailed text, of various elements of design, decoration, craftsmanship, construction, and finish of early American furniture. Each type is shown and discussed with three examples: good, better, best, comparing the relative merits and consequent value differentials of each. It explains why superficially similar pieces of furniture of the same approximate age and scarcity, and possibly by the same maker, may vary considerably in desirability and worth. It is a unique indispensible guide for today's students, collectors, dealers, and curators in judging and evaluating antiques. More than 1000 types are discussed and 675 examples are illustrated, including some of the most notable pieces. The ultimate reference, as important today as when first writen. &lt;&lt;         AUTHOR: Albert Sack has had a fascinating career as a furniture dealer and established a reputation as an authority on antiques. He was a member of the NEw York firm of Israel Sack, Inc., highly rspected and well known dealers in early American furniture. &lt;&lt; 708 b/w photos</Text>

			<Text>The Author John Weatherstone comes from a family who have been planters in the East since the 1880s and John was a planter in Ceylon for seven years.  500 b/w illustrations                                                                            This is an inspired sequel to the authors previous book "The Pioneers". In this new book the author explains how the industry has changed over the past three centuries right up to the present day. During the 18th and 19th centuries the quest for plants and seed of commercial importance was to lead to the transportation of plants from one side of the world to the other. These plants and seeds were in every sense as valuable as gold and essential to the British Empire and its continuing development and prosperity. The final chapter in this fascinating book breaks new ground by examining the state of tea plantations as we enter the 21st century. To the keen tea drinkers it graphically shows present day living conditions for the workers, as well as how tea is grown and manufactured. The book is beautifully illustrated with fine colour palte drawings, engravings and photographs, both past and present.</Text>

			<Text>In the 1950s the British Government embarked on the ambitious project of building a countrywide air defence network – The ROTOR Project. Airfields were erected around the British Isles, both underground and open to the elements. Using his archaeologist’s training, Bob Clarke has investigated the background of many of the UK’s airfields and airfield structures, asking questions about why they were built in their often widely differing locations, and which criteria affected the decisions. He uncovers in the process the fascinating thought processes behind their construction and illustrates what they reveal about the concerns of their time.    This book does not seek to cover every airfield in Britain, nor to tell the stories of the many squadrons involved. Rather, this is a history of Britain’s airfields set against the country’s varied landscape, examining both their make-up and the political background that saw them called into being. THE AUTHOR  Bob Clarke joined the RAF in 1981. For the past ten years he has worked at Boscombe Down as an archaeologist and has studied the site’s history, ancient and more recent. He lectures on archaeological and twentieth-century history for the University of Bath and has also written The Berlin Airlift: Ten Tons for Templehof and Four Minute Warning for Tempus. 180 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>This is a painstaking survey of every Scottish battle from Mons Graupius AD 84 to Culloden 1746. Scotland has been formed by war to a greater extent than almost any other nation - war against the Romans, the Vikings, one another and, throughout the medieval and early modern eras, with England. Many of Scotland's battlefields have already been covered by modern developments, many more are at risk, often because their existence, let alone significance is known to so few. If battles are 'no more than the punctuation marks of history' it is not enough to know where these punctuation marks occurred, it is important to understand why.  THE AUTHOR Chris Brown has just completed his PhD at St Andrews University. His other books include William Wallace: The True Story of Braveheart, Robert the Bruce: A Life Chronicled (‘An excellent anthology’ The Scotsman; ‘Indispensable’ The Daily Mail), The Second Scottish Wars of Independence (‘Lucid and highly readable’ History Scotland) and The Battle for Aberdeen 1644, (‘Readable and balanced’ The Scots Magazine) all published by Tempus. He lives in Edinburgh. &lt;&lt; 120 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>A novel of Isabella of Spain. She was a great woman, a great Queen, and now that Norah Lofts has written her life story she becomes a great heroine of fiction too. Crown of Aloes is presented as a personal chronicle. Within the framework of known fact and detail drawn from hitherto unexploited contemporary Spanish sources, a novelist’s imagination and understanding have provided motives, thoughts, and private conversations, helping to build up the fascinating character Isabella must have been. Her fortunes were varied indeed: she knew acute poverty, faced anxiety and danger with high courage, gave much, suffered much, lived to the full. At the end she was mainly aware of her failures. It was left to others to realise how spectacular her successes had been.  THE AUTHOR Norah Lofts was one of the best-known and best-loved of all historical novelists, known for her authentic application of period detail to all her books. She was a bestselling author on both sides of the Atlantic, was born in Norfolk. She taught English and History at a girls’ school before turning to writing full time in 1936. Her passion for old houses and their continuing history sparked off her much praised Suffolk trilogy, The Town House, The House at Old Vine and The House at Sunset. These were followed by the bestselling The Concubine, about Anne Boleyn and by The King’s Pleasure, a novel about the life of Katharine of Aragon. Lofts wrote more than 50 books, including historical non-fiction and short stories.</Text>

			<Text>The world's quietist weapon of mass destruction is 75% cotton, 25% linen and 100% fake.  Mass counterfeiting is not just organised crime, it can also be aggressive economic warfare waged by states to destabilise enemy governments - and it is reaching epidemic proportions.  Forgery also provides cash for states like North Korea and Iran in their pursuit of wapons - a fact publicly unremarked, even as fears grow over nuclear ambitions. John Cooley brings the true state of affairs tolight in this compelling, accessible account.  With a sound grounding in current events and history alike, Cooley demonstartes the machinations of today's states echo the attepmts in antiquity by Persia, Greece, Rome and China to use and defend against forgery and currency debasement.   Counterfeiting remained a high crime throughout medieval and Renaissance Europe, played a key role in the American and French Revolutions, the Napoleonic era and the American Civil War and was used by the British, Germans and Soviets in two world wars. Bad money mixed with post-war dictatorships; the KGB, CIA and Stasi; the IRA; Hizbullah; Medellin cartels and the Chinese Triads.   Grand-scaled forgery has corrosive implications for global economic, political and social stability. The world's quietest weapon of mass destruction is 75 per cent cotton, 25 per cent linen...and 100 per cent fake.   AUTHOR: John K. Cooloey worked as a newspaper and television journalist including staff correspondent for Christian Science Monitor and ABC news, who came to specialize in the Middle East.   Previews available from previous books.  SALES POINTS *Cooley maps this unwholesome matrix of war and politics, sabotage and subterfuge with new evidence and documents only recently exposed. *Reveals, astonishingly, that the extent of bogus money in curculation is unknown; that every year the authorities seize ever more hundreds of millions of counterfeit US dollars worldwide; at least 10% of euro coins are reckoned fakes *Revelations about the UK's WWI counterfeiting of imperial German Reischmarks, massive US counterfeiting in its covert and black propaganda actions in Vietnam and Laos and Stalin's dollars. *Shows how human greed and fear are eternal catalysts in world economics.</Text>

			<Text>This Pegasus flexi original explores images of the women in Rubens' life as depicted by one of the world's most passionate painters. More than thirty colour reproductions of Rubens' portraits are united by the theme of women: the faces and bodies of his wives figure prominently in each. 
From paintings of his first and second wives Isabella and Helene, to scenes depicting mythological or religious events, to images of daily life in seventeenth-century Antwerp, the full breadth of Rubens' prolific oeuvre is represented in this collection. Informative essays reveal what Rubens' portrayals of women tell us about the private life of this influential master.</Text>

			<Text>Quigte simply one of the greatest works in military history: "It is history that becomes literature. It is heroic and should be read.'  Sunday Telegraph. &lt;&lt; 'A prose epic of the bloody infantry. A sombre masterpiece.' Sunday Times                                                 ‘This will be my great work … It is done with agony and bloody sweat’ First published in 1923, Kipling’s little-known masterpiece is an utterly individual contribution to the art of regimental history. In August 1914 Kipling’s son John, not yet seventeen, volunteered for a commission in the Army, but being under age and with poor sight, was initially refused. His father’s friendship with Lord Roberts was used to gain him a commission in the Irish Guards. John Kipling’s Battalion was at once deployed in the costly battle of Loos, where he was among the earliest casualties. Kipling was devastated, and set about writing a regimental history as a monument to his son’s service. The result of five years of laborious research, it is both a military and a literary masterpiece. Kipling employed his exceptional descriptive powers, his empathy with fighting men under breaking-strain and his habitual passion for detail, to wonderful effect. Long out of print, the two volumes of The Irish Guards in the Great War, of which this is volume one, are republished in lavish, illustrated editions, complete with the original maps and appendices. &lt;&lt; THE AUTHOR Rudyard Kipling was born in 1865 in Bombay. After his schooling he returned to India in 1882 where he spent seven years as a journalist and became well known for his light and satirical verse. Returning to London in 1889 he soon gained an international reputation, and in 1907 won the Nobel Prize for literature. Among his most famous works are the Just So Stories and the two Jungle Books. &lt;&lt; 17 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Over the past decade and a half, Chilean wines have become familiar to wine lovers worldwide. But in the late 1980's the stiuation was very different. Chile s wine industry was in a backward state and those of its wines that found their way out onto the international stage were little more than curiosities.  In 1988, four Chilean wine professionals came together with a simple plan to break away from the mould: to capitalise on the country's heaven-sent clmate and winemaking potential and make the very best wines that Chile could offer. From modest beginnings it was a plan that has grown, in only a matter of years, into one of the greawt modern-day wine success stories - one that has helped change the perception of Chile as a wine-producing country.  The name of the venture is Montes and in this book Jamie Ross tells its remarkable story.  Author Jamie Ross was born and educated in London. Aftger university, he worked for the Chilean wine producer Vina San Pedro, where he met the founders of what was to become the Montes winery. He has been fascinated by Chile and its wines ever since. He now works in publishing and has written freelance for several British national newspapers. Jamie lives in central London with his wife and three children.    --Winner Gourmand World Book Award 2006, Best Wine History Book   --Lavish photographs of founders, vineyards and cellars. Includes never-before-seen, turn-of-the-century daguerreotypes  --Quick guide to founder Aurelio Montes favorite Montes wines produced to date   --Color maps of the Montes Winery region along with production statistics according to wine variety   --Foreword by Hugh Johnson</Text>

			<Text>In this groundbreaking follow-up to her bestselling books The Verbally Abusive Relationship and Controlling People, Patricia Evans goes beyond identifying verbally abusive behaviors to prescribing a course of action for both victim and abuser. Coupling stories of abused women and abusive men from her own case studies, Evans gives you the tools you need to transform your relationship. Most important, she assures you that such a transformation is possible-given the right circumstances. Evans also helps you determine if your abuser really has changed-or if he's merely creating the illusion of change. And if he hasn't changed, Evans helps you decide whether it's time to leave the relationship-and what to do when it is. Combining practical applications and the latest clinical research with her trademark support and assurance, Evans shows you how to empower yourself, improve your relationship, and change your life for the better.  Patricia Evans is the bestselling author of four books and a highly acclaimed interpersonal communications specialist, public speaker, and consultant. She's appeared on Oprah, CNN, national radio, and in Newsweek and O, The Oprah Magazine. She lives in the East Bay Area of San Francisco, CA, and can be reached via her Web site, www.VerbalAbuse.com.</Text>

			<Text>If you or someone you know answers "yes" to one or more of the following questions, this book is required reading: Does your partner seem irritated or angry at you several times a week? Does he deny being angry when he clearly is? Do your attempts to discuss feelings of pain or emotional distress leave you with the feeling that the issue has not been resolved? Do you frequently feel perplexed and frustrated by his responses, as though you were each speaking a different language? Almost everyone has heard of or knows someone who is part of a verbally abusive relationship-if they're not involved in one themselves. In The Verbally Abusive Relationship, you'll find validation, understanding, and encouragement for your decision to change the situation. In this expanded second edition, author Patricia Evans explores the damaging effects of verbal abuse on children and the family, and offers valuable insight and recommendations to the abusers, as well as those who seek therapeutic support.  Patricia Evans, speaker, consultant, and founder of the Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute, conducts workshops and professional training throughout the country.</Text>

			<Text>Always needs to be right  Tells you who you are and what you think  Implies that you're wrong or inadequate when you don't agree  Is threatened by people different from him- or herself  Feels attacked when questioned  Doesn't seem to really hear or see you If any of the traits above sound familiar, help is on the way! In Controlling People, bestselling author Patricia Evans (The Verbally Abusive Relationship) tackles the "controlling personality," and reveals why and how these people try to run other people's lives. She also explains the compulsion that makes them continue this behavior-even as they alienate others and often lose those they love.  Patricia Evans is the founder of the Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute in Alamo, CA. She conducts workshops across the country, and has made numerous media appearances. Her first book, The Verbally Abusive Relationship, was praised by Newsweek as "groundbreaking."</Text>

			<Text>Biba remains one of the most evocative names in British design history; it pioneered a new style, mixing the contemporary with Art Nouveau, Art Deco and the golden age of Hollywood, dressing itself in the richly luxuriant colours of a bygone time. This book showcases Biba clothing and much of the Biba memorabilia, merchandising and interior design, presenting an entire history of the company. Biba: The Biba Experience centres on commissioned photographs of one of the largest collections of Biba in the world, put together by Pari, who has accumulated around 500 pieces of Biba fashion items and ephemera covering the entire history of the company. Everything from dresses and trouser suits through original sketches and patterns to playing cards and soap powder is represented Biba brought the cutting edge of couture to the masses. Brigitte Bardot, Yoko Ono and Princess Anne shopped there, whilst Sonny and Cher, Mick and Marianne, and David and Angie were regular visitors, but the store was never the exclusive preserve of the rich and famous: prices were kept deliberately low, and anyone who could tolerate the disdainful inefficiency of the staff was encouraged to soak up the glamour of a unique shopping experience. This lavishly illustrated and beautifully produced book is intended for those interested in the fashion and graphic design of the '60s and '70s, from a creative and historical standpoint, plus the huge number of people who remember Biba from the period with such affection. Luxury paperback edition of a widely-praised bestseller, providing a stunning pictorial biography of an iconic British fashion label and store of the 60s and 70s  Keenly priced at £20.00 to reach an expanded audience of fashion and design fans  'A must-buy for anyone seeking inspiration or a gentle reminder of a creative legend'  Vogue'All that a girl should know about fashion and style is in this book' - Elle Girl 200 colour &amp; 50 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>This glorious book is filled to the brim with a wide ranging history of textiles and 350 superb illustrations drawn from many countries and sources vestments and costume, samplers and pictures, great beds and furniture. The story of embroidery and needlework is discussed within the fascinating context of the history of fabrics, of decorative costume, of interior decoration, of church and state ceremonial, of girl's education, of furniture and pastimes. Silk, cotton, linen, and the significance of colours and dyes are also considered. Two interesting chapters reveal the world-wide fascination in an influence of Chinese embroidery and Indian textiles. With a broad account of the artistic achievements of every facet of decorative needlework the book is rich with the art-historical background encompassing the most magnificent of all embroidery, the mediaeval English vestments so coveted by Popes and Bishops across Europe, to the domestic treasures created in more recent centuries. Baroque, Rococo, neo-classical and other period characteristics are each discussed with reference to works created by children, young girls, and ladies who made furniture coverings destined for posterity. The nineteenth century saw extremes of art and fashion ranging from Berlin woolwork to Art Needlework and the eclectic inspiration represented by William Morris, all leading to simpler modernist styles which evolved over the twentieth century. The author sets in political and social context the whole panoply of textiles distinguishing between the magnificent products of professional workshops and the uniquely individual and especially charming amateur embroideries that survive today amongst the most beautiful treasures of the decorative arts. Mr Synge's text is authoritative but examines with infectious enthusiasm this field which has never been sufficiently understood but now interests more people than ever before. It will appeal to all who admire beautiful things, fine workmanship, good design and lovely fabrics.</Text>

			<Text>The average person considering buying gem set jewellery or loose stones is faced with a fabulous glittering and colourful array of beauty and value. A wide choice of stones, some with household names, others strange but very attractive. Complicating things even more are the doubts as to which are real and which fake. The situation becomes more difficult each year as techniques for ‘improving’ stones progress and synthetics swamp the market. Gemstones is a unique book that introduces the layperson to this complex world in simple and easily understandable terms. Describing what constitutes a gemstone, their history and some myths and legends surrounding them begin the introduction. This is followed by a section covering seventy or so gems with an emphasis on diamond, particularly its identification. A section on organic gems i.e. ivory, shell, coral etc. follows. Both these sections are fully illustrated with colour photographs of the stones. A trip around the world follows, covering many countries visited by those on holiday or business and describing what, and in some cases where, to buy. Words of warning are also given as to what one should avoid. The influence of the Internet is recognised, with relevant websites helpfully listed. Appendices cover translation in four European languages, physical properties of the gems and colours. A glossary of terms and a comprehensive index is included. The Author Keith Wallis is a qualified gemmologist and a Fellow of the Gemmological Association of Great Britain (Gem A). He was responsible for the design and development of an inexpensive range of test instruments that the student of gemmology could afford.   Clear uncomplicated presentation Quality colour photographs illustrate the many gems A comprehensive index A totally unique approach to the subject Provides guidelines for the basic identification of gemstones in an easily accessible manner 218 colour &amp; 24 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>This exuberant, touching memoir opens on St Patrick’s Day, 1936, with America in the throes of the Great Depression. The six-year-old author, accompanied by his younger sister Anne-Marie and their spirited but vulnerable mother, has just arrived on the porch of their new home in Albany, where his feckless, often absent father has promised a brave new life will begin. But the father never shows up, and the family are thrown back once again on their own resources.   For the next 8 years, through the end of the Great Depression and into World War Two, they live in the heart of the Irish slum, surrounded by ward heelers, unemployment and grinding poverty, as well as the eccentric ‘crazyladies’ of the title.   Told from the point of view of the author’s younger self, with honesty, candour and a fascinating eye for period detail, Crazyladies offers a marvellous portrait of a child forced to grow up too fast. A funny, deeply moving memoir, which also paints a vivid portrait of a neighbourhood, a city and a whole nation of people waiting for a better life to come.     “Vivid and absorbing”  PUBLISHING NEWS   “Literary time travel”  WASHINGTON POST   “A heartfelt and unforgettable look back at one child’s life in the 1930s and 1940s, that will be remembered long after the last page is turned.”  SIMPLYAUDIOBOOKS.COM  “A nostalgic, richly textured autobiography. Trevanian sweetly evokes an innocent if hardscrabble lost age.” PUBLISHERS WEEKLY  Trevanian was a shadowy figure. In his lifetime, he is said to have written under at least five different pseudonyms in at least five different genres, although he is probably best known for the spy thrillers The Eiger Sanction, The Loo Sanction and Shibumi and his highly acclaimed memoir The Crazyladies of Pearl Street.  What is certain is that he was born an American named Rodney Whitaker, he spent much of his adult life in the French Basque country – where The Summer of Katya is set – and he died in 2005 in the west of England.</Text>

			<Text>Insanity Streak cartoonist Tony Lopes works with one simple motto in mind: ‘Above all else, make them laugh’. Through this single-panel floating theme cartoon, Lopes applies his keen wit to the small moments of everyday life, finding humour in the quirks of human nature.  Since 1995, Lopes has amassed an impressive list of awards and his work has been growing in popularity across the world. He recently won Best Comic Strip award for the fourth time with the Australian Cartoonists Association Stanley Awards, voted by industry peers.   ‘Insanity Streak’ is the only cartoon to win Stanley awards in both the comic strip and single gag categories. It has also twice been judged Best Comic Strip at the Rotary International Cartoon Awards which are presented at Coffs Harbour, NSW.  Currently ‘Insanity Streak’ is published in more than 50 Australian newspapers, including leading publications such as The Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Canberra Times  and Sunday Mail, as well as a couple of weeklies. Internationally, his work appears in the UK’s Daily Mail and is syndicated in Hong Kong, Malaysia, South Africa, Cyprus and New Zealand.</Text>

			<Text>Cartoonist Tony Lopes works with one simple motto in mind: "Above all else, make them laugh". And that is certainly the case with his hugely popular comic strip INSANITY STREAK, which he created in 1995. Through this single-panel, floating theme cartoon, Lopes applies his keen wit to the small moments of everyday life, finding humour in the quirks of human nature. Since 1995, Lopes has amassed an impressive list of awards and his work has been growing in popularity across the world. He has twice won Best Comic Strip and once Best Single gag artist with 'Insanity Streak' at the Australian Cartoonists Association Stanley Awards, voted by industry peers. 'Insanity Streak' is the only cartoon to win Stanley awards in both the comic strip and single gag categories. 'Insanity Streak' has also twice been judged Best Comic Strip at the Rotary International Cartoon Awards, which are presented in Coffs Harbour, Australia. Currently, 'Insanity Streak' is published in more than 50 Australian newspapers, including leading publications such as The Daily Telegraph, Sunday Telegraph, Canberra Times and Sunday Mail. Internationally, his work appears in the UK's Daily Mail and is syndicated in Hong Kong (daily in the South China Morning Post), Malaysia, South Africa, Cyprus and New Zealand (Waikato Times, and Daily Times in New Plymouth). Sweden is currently promoting the cartoon and interest has been received from Norway. These are the first two 'Insanity Streak' books to be published and enough strips are available to ensure continuity as the series grows.</Text>

			<Text>Where will the baby be born? Are you going to have all the tests? When will you start your maternity leave? As if being pregnant wasn’t a major new challenge to deal with already, suddenly you’re expected to make loads of critical decisions with no previous experience whatever. And everyone from your best friend to your mother-in-law is giving you different advice.  The worst of it is that you want to enjoy the pregnancy, not spend it fretting about when to tell your boss, or whether to have a caesarean.  That’s just where a new book, Pregnancy for Beginners, comes in. Written by the author of the hugely popular Babies for Beginners, it takes you calmly through all the crucial decisions you may have to make, and a few that aren’t so vital but which seem hugely important when you’re pregnant (when to decorate the nursery, or whether to find out if it’s a boy or a girl).  Pregnancy for Beginners never tells you what decision to make – only you know what’s right for you – but it sets out the options clearly, gives you the pros and cons of each, the worst case scenario, key questions to ask yourself and other decision-making tools to help you find the answer that suits you best. So now you can relax and enjoy your pregnancy</Text>

			<Text>This poem is the story of the hero Aeneas as he flees from Troy, and after many ordeals and suffering carves out a foothold for the future Romans in Italy. While defining and celebrating what it meant to be Roman, it confronts, with a bleak pathos, the tragedy involved in the destiny of Rome.</Text>

			<Text>A new version of John Payne's Victorian translation, with an Introduction by Cormac O Cuilleanain  1348. The Black Death is sweeping through Europe. In Florence, plague has carried off one hundred thousand people. In their Tuscan villas, seven young women and three young men tell tales to recreate the world they have lost, weaving a rich tapestry of comedy, tragedy, ribaldry and farce. Boccaccio's Decameron recasts the storytelling heritage of the ancient and medieval worlds into perennial forms that inspired writers from Chaucer and Shakespeare down to our own day. Boccaccio makes the incredible believable, with detail so sharp we can look straight into the lives of people who lived six hundred years ago. His Decameron hovers between the fading glories of an aristocratic past - the Crusades, the Angevins, the courts of France, the legendary East - and the colourful squalor of contemporary life, where wives deceive husbands, friars and monks pursue fleshly ends, and natural instincts fight for satisfaction. Here are love and jealousy, passion and pride - and a shrewd calculation of profit and loss which heralds the rise of a dynamic merchant class. These stories show us early capitalism during a moment of crisis and revelation.</Text>

			<Text>Goethe's Faust is a classic of European literature. Based on the fable of the man who traded his soul for superhuman powers and knowledge, it became the life's work of Germany's greatest poet. Beginning with an intriguing wager between God and Satan, it charts the life of a deeply  flawed individual, his struggle against the nihilism of his diabolical companion Mephistopheles. Part One presents Faust's pact with the Devil and the harrowing tragedy of his love affair with the young Gretchen. Part Two shows Faust's experience in the world of public affairs, including his encounter with Helen of Troy, the emblem of classical beauty and culture. The whole is a symbolic and panoramic commentary on the human condition and on modern European history and civilisation. This new translation of both parts of Faust preserves the poetic character of the original, its tragic pathos and hilarious comedy.  In addition, John Williams has translated the Urfaust, a fascinating   glimpse into the young Goethe's imagination, and a selection from   the draft scenarios for the Walpurgis Night witches' sabbath - material   so ribald and blasphemous that Goethe did not dare publish it</Text>

			<Text>Writing his "Comedy" (the epithet "Divine" was added by later admirers) in exile from his native Florence, Dante aimed to address a world gone astray both morally and politically. It tells the story of a character who is at one and the same time both Dante himself and Everyman.</Text>

			<Text>Sigmund Freud's audacious masterpiece, The Interpretation of Dreams, has never ceased to stimulate controversy since its publication in 1900. Freud is acknowledged as the founder of psychoanalysis, the key to unlocking the human mind, a task which has become essential to man's survival in the twentieth century, as science and technology have rushed ahead of our ability to cope with their consequences. Freud saw that man is at war with himself and often unable to tolerate too much reality. He propounded the theory that dreams are the contraband representations of the beast within man, smuggled into awareness during sleep. In Freudian interpretation, the analysis of dreams is the key to unlocking the secrets of the unconscious mind.</Text>

			<Text>As Fyodor Karamazov awaits an amorous encounter, he is violently done to death. The three sons of the old debauchee are forced to confront their own guilt or complicity. Who will own to parricide? The reckless and passionate Dmitri? The corrosive intellectual Ivan? Surely not the chaste novice monk Alyosha? The search reveals the divisions which rack the brothers, yet paradoxically unite them. Around the writhings of this one dysfunctional family Dostoevsky weaves a dense network of social, psychological and philosophical relationships. At the same time he shows - from the opening 'scandal' scene in the monastery to a personal appearance by an eccentric Devil - that his dramatic skills have lost nothing of their edge. The Karamazov Brothers, completed a few months before Dostoevsky's death in 1881, remains for many the high point of his genius as novelist and chronicler of the modern malaise. It casts a long shadow over D.H.Lawrence, Thomas Mann, Albert Camus, and other giants of twentieth-century literature.</Text>

			<Text>Marcel Proust (1871-1922) spent the last fourteen years of hgis life writing A la recherche du temps perdu. It is an intimate epic, an excavation of the self and a comedy of manners by turns and all at once. Proust is the twentieth century Dante, presenting us with a unique, unsettling picture of ourselves as jealous lovers and unmitigated snobs, frittering our lives away, with only the hope of ar and a possible salvation. He offers us a form of redemption for a sober and secular age.  Scott Moncrieff’s delightful translation was for many years the only access to Proust in English. A labour of love that took him nearly as many years as Proust spent writing the original, Moncrieff’s translation strives to capture the extraordinary blend of muscular analysis with poetic reverie that typifies Proust’s style. It remains a justly famous classic of translation. Marcel Proust (1871-1922) spent the last fourteen years of hgis life writing A la recherche du temps perdu.

			<Text>Darwin's theory of natural selection issued a profound challenge to orthodox thought and belief: no being or species has been specially created; all are locked into a pitiless struggle for existence, with extinction looming for those not fit enough for the task. This text reveals the almost unthinkably complex mutual interdependencies between animal and plant life, climate and physical environment, and by implication, the human world.</Text>

			<Text>Translated by C.E.Detmold  With an Introduction by Lucille Margaret Kekewich  Written in 1513 for the Medici, following their return to power in Florence, The Prince is a handbook on ruling and the exercise of power. It remains as relevant today as it was in the sixteenth century. Widely quoted in the Press and in academic publications, The Prince has direct relevance to the issues of business and corporate governance confronting global corporations as they enter a new millennium. Much of what Machiavelli wrote has become the common currency of realpolitik, yet still his ideas retain the power to shock and annoy. In the words of Norman Stone, The Prince is 'a manual of man-management that would suit a great many parts of the modern world'.</Text>

			<Text>The 112 Upanishads form the final section of the Veda - the oldest Hindu scriptures. Upanishadic principles include the beliefs that the world appears real without being so and that yoga and spiritual disciplines are necessary to unite individual and universal Selves. Composed in Sanskrit between 900 and 600 BC, the Upanishads are man's oldest works of philosophy. The translations presented here are the oldest and most important of those that exist.</Text>

			<Text>Antigone, Oedipus the Tyrant &amp; Oedipus at Colonus  Translated,with an Introduction and Notes by Jamey Hecht  The story of Oedipus has captured the human imagination as few others. It is the story of a man fated to kill his father and marry his mother, a man who by a cruel irony brings these things to pass by his very efforts to avoid them. But these plays are not about fate, and not about irony. They are about character, choice and consequence. In Antigone we see a woman who will defy human law, and die for it, rather than transgress the eternal, unwritten laws of the gods. Oedipus the Tyrant is the story of a ruler destroyed by those qualities - pride, determination and belief in his own abilities - which made him ruler in the first place. Finally, in Oedipus at Colonus, written late in Sophocles' life, the aged and blinded king achieves a personal reconciliation, but at a cost - a son who will die in battle against his country, and a daughter who will die burying her brother.</Text>

			<Text>The Little Prince is a classic tale of equal appeal to children and adults. On one level it is the story of an airman's discovery, in the desert, of a small boy from another planet - the Little Prince of the title - and his stories of intergalactic travel, while on the other hand it is a thought-provoking allegory of the human condition. First published in 1943, the year before the author's death in action, this translation contains Saint-Exupery's delightful illustrations.</Text>

			<Text>Little Women is one of the best-loved children's stories of all time, based on the author's own youthful experiences. It describes the family life of the four March sisters living in a small New England community, Meg, the eldest, is pretty and wishes to be a lady; Jo, at fifteen is ungainly and unconventional with an ambition to be an author; Beth is a delicate child of thirteen with a taste for music and Amy is a blonde beauty of twelve. The story of their domestic adventures, their attempts to increase the family income, their friendship with the neighbouring Lawrence family, and their later love affairs remains as fresh and beguiling as ever.   Good Wives takes up the story of the March sisters, some three years later, when, as young adults, they must face up to the inevitable trials and traumas of everyday life in their search for individual happiness.</Text>

			<Text>Eight of the twelve tales in this book are from the master hand of Charles Perrault (1628-1703). Although Perrault enjoyed much distinction in the French literary circle of the late seventeenth century, his fame today rests upon his authorship of the traditional 'Tales of Mother Goose', or 'Stories of Olden Times'. And it is true to say that as long as there are children to listen spellbound to the adventures of 'Cinderella', 'Red Riding Hood', and that arch rogue 'Puss in Boots', his memory will endure. Three of the tales, 'The Ridiculous Wishes', 'Donkey-Skin' and 'Patient Griselda', are seldom included in Perrault collections as they were written in a very florid verse form. Not only Perrault, but Boccaccio, Chaucer and others have used the story of 'Patient Griselda'. The last story, 'Beauty and the Beast', again not by Perrault (it was penned by Mme. Leprince de Beaumont 1711-1781), has a similarity of style and celebrity which justifiably merits its inclusion.</Text>

			<Text>Including The Watsons and Lady Susan   With an introduction by J.H. Stape, St Mary’s College, Strawberry Hill   Enormously influential on all later biographies of Jane Austen, the Memoir of Jane Austen (1869) by her nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh enjoys the privileged perspective of first-hand knowledge. It displays the deft touch of a man trained in the compassionate observation of human fallibility and virtue. Austen-Leigh’s highly readable and affectionate account of his aunt offers a vividly compelling portrait of Jane Austen’s habits and personality. Accompanied by the novella Lady Susan and the unfinished The Watsons, this edition is simply essential reading for any admirer of a writer whom Virginia Woolf called ‘the most perfect artist among women’.   You may have noticed that Jane's picture on the cover is slightly different to the way that history has traditionally remembered her. Readers of  The Times will be aware that Jane has been the beneficiary of a 'Wordsworth Makeover'. The only contemporary portrait of her, by her sister Cassandra, was described by her niece as being 'hideously unlike' her, and she was described by friends and family as 'very attractive', and 'like a doll'. We have done our best to set the record straight...  Special thanks to Tony Collins at The Design House for the artwork.</Text>

			<Text>The Aylmer Vance stories date from the Edwardian period, and there are echoes in them of the Sherlock Holmes adventures which had proved so popular in the preceding decade. The friendship between Aylmer Vance and Dexter is not unlike that between Sherlock Holmes and Watson, and the two investigators approach the world of the supernatural in the same fearless and enquiring spirit in which Conan Doyle's heroes approach the world of crime. The parallel is not exact: Dexter, with his clairvoyant powers, is a more useful (and intelligent) ally than Watson, and Vance for the most part does not 'solve' mysteries the way Holmes does. What we get instead is a loosely-connected series of stories in which surprise is the major element, a world where not all ghosts are bad, where it is not always clear whether they are ghosts, and where being dead may for some be better than being alive.</Text>

			<Text>"OUR BEST WRITER OF GHOST STORIES!"* Steven King was influenced by the work of William Hope Hodgson, while horror maestro H. P. Lovecraft hailed Carnacki, Ghost Finder as a work of "undeniable power [that] affords glimpses of the peculiar genius characteristic of the author," and hailed the author, writing that "Few can equal him in adumbrating the nearness of nameless forces and monstrous besieging entities through casual hints and insignificant details, or in conveying feelings of the spectral and the abnormal in connection with regions or buildings." William Hope Hodgson was one of the archetypal masters of gaslight era horror, and Carnacki ranks as one of his proudest creation. For, the quiet, colorless man with the apartment by the river is in actuality a ghost-hunter and demon-layer extraordinaire. Armed with an encyclopedic knowledge of the arcane arts and supernatural manifestations, Carnacki puts on his coat and turns up the collar before stepping out the door to confront demons, hauntings, invisible presences, and fifth dimensional intrusions. Journey with him - if you dare - while Carnacki confronts "The Thing Invisible," enters "The Gateway of the Monster," braves the terrors of "The Whistling Room," battles a dread entity from another realm, "The Hog," Hodgson is "Our best writer of ghost stories." (~The Liverpool Courier.) Here is a genuine classic of supernatural fiction no horror fan can afford to miss. Cover: Elspeth Fahey.</Text>

			<Text>With an Introduction by Antony Lejeune  The Devil Rides Out is the most famous work of a master storyteller, a classic of weird fiction which has been described as 'the best thing of its kind since Dracula' a genuinely frightening tale of devil-worship and sorcery in modern Britain.  A group of old friends discover that one of them has been lured into a coven of Satanists. They determine to rescue him - and a beautiful girl employed as a medium. The head of the coven proves to be no charlatan but an Adept of the Dark Arts, able to infiltrate dreams and conjure up fearsome entities.  De Richleau fights back with his own knowledge of occultism and ancient lore. A duel ensues between White and Black Magic, Good and Evil used as weapons.  Whenever, subsequentley, Dennis Wheatley was asked what he really believed about the supernatural, he would just reply 'Don't meddle!' Few readers will need that warning repeated.</Text>

			<Text>With an Introduction by Anthony Lejeune  Night after night, out there in the moonlight, Something was trying to get in at the bedroom window. A huge malevolent Something. Something not of this world. Inside, Toby Jugg, a wounded Battle of Britain pilot, thought first that he was hallucinating, then that he must be going mad, finally that this evil Something was real and striving to reach him.  So begins what is probably Dennis Wheatley’s most terrifying story of the supernatural. The struggle which ensues brought Toby unexpected help but also ungues treachery as it moves inexorably towards an appalling confrontation and seemingly inevitable catastrophe.   No wonder Dennis Wheatley was called “The Prince of Thriller Writers”.</Text>

			<Text> A collection of Mummy stories selected and introduced by David Stuart Davies  Beware, the Dead are coming back! This is a unique and fascinating collection of early mummy stories that helped to establish the chilling concept of the Dead returning to life as a potent sub-genre of horror fiction.  The main feature on the mummy bill, The Jewel of the Seven Stars by Bram Stoker, is generally regarded as his best work after Dracula. A weird mixture of adventure, the supernatural and science fiction is found in Jane Webb's The Mummy, a tale written in 1827 but set in 2126. Some Words with a Mummy is by the great horror writer Edgar Allen Poe. Arthur Conan Doyle's The Ring of Thoth is the classic mummy tale and was the basis for the 1932 movie 'The Mummy' starring Boris Karloff and, indeed most mummy films ever since. Lot 249, another Doyle chiller, completes this collection, which is guaranteed to entertain and possibly prompt a nightmare.</Text>

			<Text>Edited and With an Introduction by David Stuart Davies  'Some six or seven feet above the port bulwarks, framed in fog, and as utterly unsupported as the full moon, hung a Face. It was not human, and it certainly was not animal, for it did not belong to this earth as known to man'   Rudyard Kipling, celebrated author of  The Jungle Book, the Just So Stories and other entertaining fictions, was also a master of the short story in which he was able to combine the strange and unnerving in order to draw the reader into the world of his own dark imaginings.   This collection presents the best of these strange tales in which ghosts, monsters and inexplicable happenings abound. From the exotic and magical locale of India, to the leafy suburbs of England and then to the blood-soaked trenches of the First World War, Kipling provides us with a chilling array of experiences and images which will linger long in the memory.</Text>

			<Text>This title is edited and features an introduction by Dick Collins. In the midst of a wood of evergreens on the banks of the Arno, a man - young, handsome, and splendidly attired - has thrown himself upon the ground, where he writhes like a stricken serpent. He is the prey of a demoniac excitement: an appalling consternation is upon him - madness is in his brain - his mind is on fire. Lightnings appear to gleam from his eyes - as if his soul were dismayed, and withering within his breast. 'Oh! no -no!' he cries with a piercing shriek, as if wrestling madly - furiously - but vainly, against some unseen fiend that holds him in his grasp.Aged and deserted, Fernand Wagner agrees to serve John Faust for the last year of his life. In return he is given youth, wealth and beauty - but at the terrible price of becoming a werewolf. He loves the glacial, beautiful, sensual Nisida, whose family history conceals a dreadful secret. Together, they flee from Florence to a desert island: but dogged by the Inquisition, and by the might of the Ottoman Empire, they are finally forced to face the horror that lurks in the closet... First published in 1847, "Wagner the Werewolf" is one of the very earliest treatments of the Werewolf theme in English literature, and has lost none of its power to shock, it is one of the greatest works of George W.M. Reynolds, once the most popular author in England, and the "Master of the Penny Dreadful".</Text>

			<Text>Jocelyn Pierston, celebrated sculptor, tries to create an image of his ideal woman - his imaginary "Well-Beloved" - in stone, just as he tries to find her in the flesh. Using this symbolism, this romantic fantasy is grounded in reality with a characteristically authentic rendering of location, the Isle of Slingers, or Portland as we know it.      This book has an introduction and notes by Jane Thomas, of the University of Hull. "The Well-Beloved" completes the cycle of Hardy's great novels, reiterating his favourite themes of man's eternal quest for perfection in both love and art, and the suffering that ensues. Jocelyn Pierston, celebrated sculptor, tries to create an image of his ideal woman - his imaginary "Well-Beloved" - in stone, just as he tries to find her in the flesh. Powerful symbolism marks this romantic fantasy that Hardy has grounded firmly in reality with a characteristically authentic rendering of location, the Isle of Slingers, or Portland as we know it. Overt exploration of the relationship between erotic fascination and creativity makes this novel a nineteenth-century landmark in the persistent debate about art, aesthetics and gender.</Text>

			<Text>Maps That Made History is a unique collection of the most remarkable maps of all time accompanied by their fascinating stories. Few people can resist the appeal of old maps and plans. Even in these days of disposable mapping - from satellite navigation to customized road directions at the click of a mouse - the historical map continues to present a unique perspective on our changing world. Here we explore 25 glorious examples. The emphasis is on the story behind the map: what it reveals about its creators and users, from the first explorers to the railway builders. This thought-provoking collection features maps that chart societies as well as land, seas and skies; maps that have influenced and inspired; and perhaps most revealing of all, maps that misrepresent. The book features some of our most remarkable historical maps from the Garden of Eden to the D-Day landings. Each reproduction is accompanied by the full story behind the map, focusing on the most intriguing details. This title will be appreciated by all who love history, travel and beautiful cartography.

			<Text>For centuries, artists have been studying and learning through anatomy, the science of the physical structure of humans and animals. Through it, artists have gained a basic comprehension for their depiction of form and movement of humans and animals in drawing, painting and sculpture. With over 1200 detailed illustrations by the Hungarian Andras Szunyoghy, a master of the field, the Anatomy Drawing School is an extensive insight into the bodily composition of humans and selected mammals. Meticulous studies of the skeleton and muscles encourage a better understanding of how this bodily machine is constructed, and how these basic forms can be developed into individual beings. All illustrations are accompanied by clear and detailed comments by professor Gyorgy Feher. His descriptions go beyond the basic anatomy of the depicted animals to present the reader with a lively picture of the animal as a whole. The Anatomy Drawing School unites artistic representation and scientific fact in a standard reference work designed to meet the requirements of all artists and students of drawing as well as everyone interested in anatomy.>>Andras Szunyoghy is Professor at the Institute for Anatomical Drawing in the Academy of Applied Arts in Budapest. He is a graphic artist, a painter and stamp designer. He expanded his knowledge of human anatomy at the Academy of Arts as a pupil of Jeno Barcsay, artist and author of Artistic Anatomy. Professor Gyorgy Feher was a researcher and lecturer at the Institute for Anatomy and Histiology at the Budapest Veterinary Science University from 1969 until 1987. In his numerous publications he has since devoted himself to anatomy for artists with particular emphasis on functional and applied anatomy.</Text>

			<Text>In the golden summer of 1914, Jean-Marc Montjean, recently graduated from medical school, comes to the small French village of Salies to assist the village physician. His first assignment is to treat the brother of a beautiful woman named Katya Treville. As he and her family become friendly, he realizes they are haunted by an old, dark secret . . . but he can’t help falling deeply in love with Katya.  Jean-Marc is warned by Katya’s brother that she is delicate and that he should curb his attentions, but he is young, hopeful, and in love . . . and he is certain that Katya returns his affections. When Jean-Marc learns that the Trevilles are planning to leave the village forever, he insists on a final meeting with Katya. That meeting and the events that follow turn what was an idyllic romance into an unending nightmare. Katya’s secret is revealed in a thrilling tale that is part love story and part psychological thriller, and the chilling climax will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.   Praise“A most exquisite, elegant, ingenious thriller.” —New York Daily News  “A tour de force . . . A story that explores meticulously some of the darker corners of the human soul.” —Washington Post   Author BiographyTrevanian’s books have been translated into more than fourteen languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide. He lives in the French Basque mountains. His new novel, The Crazyladies of Pearl Street, is now available in hardcover.

			<Text>From the creators of the hugely successful A Rhyming History of Britain, here is another illuminating little book on a British treasure  Shakespeare. Once more, in the winning combination of words and illustrations that is their hallmark, James Muirden’s verse is brilliantly enhanced by David Eccles’s witty drawings.  Muirden has distilled each of the thirty-six plays into a poem of a few pages. Plots and characters are crystallised to wonderful effect so that the outlines of even the least known historical plays emerge with clarity.  Like its predecessor, A Rhyming History of Britain, wacky, fun and memorable (Good Book Guide), this book will prove invaluable to everyone  whether they are doing Shakespeare at school, want simply to brush up on a plot before going to the theatre or just find another perfect Christmas present.   It’s a pretty safe bet That you know Juliet Has a Balcony Scene in her play... And which Prince cannot see That it’s better To Be... And which King gives his kingdom away.   But the Bard wrote far more (Thirty-something’s the score); And only an utter fanatic Will have seen every one  Some plays grim, others fun, But all, in the full sense, dramatic.   In this volume you’ve got An account of each plot In delicate versification, With acts, scenes, and quotes, Plus poetical notes  And Eccles inspired decoration. </Text>

			<Text>Sprinkled with pearls, hearts, stars and gemstones full of symbolism, a charm bracelet is the ultimate in meaningful jewellery. Following the development of modern jewellery-making methods that do not require soldering, and the craze for customising that has brought a cornucopia of contemporary charms to the market, the new jeweller now has the chance to make long-lasting, pretty, high-quality pieces at home. In her first book, accomplished contemporary jeweller Gabriella Sellors shows you how to design and create your own beautiful pieces using a wide variety of inexpensive materials and charms, such as faux pearls, freshwater coloured pearls, glass, semi-precious stones, and silver and gold charms. Gabriella begins with a glossary of charms and their meanings, and also provides a masterclass in creating and designing charms, showing you which materials work best with each other and which set each off. The main projects feature 50 designs for charm bracelets, necklaces, earrings and rings, as well as bag and mobile phone charms. Through chapters 'Protection and Healing', 'Love', 'Zodiac' and 'Colour', she shows you how to create charms for every occasion - charms for friendship, birthstone charms for birthdays and semi-precious charms for protection against negative energy. She also makes use of new charms on the market to personalise gifts for friends and family - a fairy charm for a friend's safety while travelling, handbag and shoe charms for your shopping-mad friend, and a series of symbolic flower charms for a bouquet of bridal charms. Including ethnic charms from the Orient, such as jade, coins, amber and the characters for love, hope, peace and joy, as well as designs for the traditional Western celebrations of anniversaries, holidays, coming of age and friendship, the book is a compendium of practical advice and inspiration for you to create unique pieces of lasting beauty</Text>

			<Text>First and only monograph dedicated to the sublime work of the Belgian abstract sculptor Jean-Pierre Ghysels   Though little-known outside Belgium, Ghysels' sculpture is of the highest order and can be compared stylistically to Brancusi and Henry Moore  "The forms are the sculpture. They are its limbs.They create free movement, the articulation of corporal movements, breathing, heartbeats, cries and murmurs. They move. Jean-Pierre Ghysels' sculptures do not break the roundness of the terrestrial globe.They are in dialogue with it and live within it. They have their spaces and refuges. They are interlaced ensembles, an encounter between matter and space, images of the earth on or under which we live." Jean-Pierre van Tieghem.  Jean-Pierre Ghysels was born in Brussels in 1932. After graduating from the Maredsous Art School in 1952, he went to Paris on a grant where he studied under Ossip Zadkine at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and developed stone carving technique at the École des Beaux-Arts. From 1958 to 1960 he travelled through Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Keenly interested in form, in 1965 he began to make a smooth transition from figurative work to abstraction and has never turned back. His bronze and copper sculptures are made of gentle, sparing shapes that with the play of light transform into subtle assemblages of solids and spaces. This monograph presents a striking and representative selection of the work of this artist who belongs to the lyrical abstract movement.  Text in English and French.     Jean-Pierre van Tieghem is a Belgian contemporary art critic. He has a radio programme on art and writes regularly for the magazine + -0.    150 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Wildfowling calls for hardiness, patience, a willingness to learn, and the ability to be content with a small bag, or none at all. And yet, of all shooting sports, it is the most romantic, potentially the most dangerous, and many would say, the purest form of hunting. This indispensable guide is a thorough introduction to the sport, covering all aspects of wildfowling: quarry species, equipment, reconnaissance, roosting, flightlines, and tactics on the marsh. &lt;&lt;     AUTHOR: The British Association for Shooting and Conservation  Colour photos throughout</Text>

			<Text>Unique and hilarious send-up of Victorian pedantry and smut “Dear Mr [Oscar] Wilde, I thank you for your letter with its enclosed cutting of your review published in The Times on Tuesday last. Your comments about my latest work were an unexpected kindness and were no less welcome for being unsolicited. I fear my work must seem dry and uninspiring next to your own for I am a man of science and not a pederast...” This is the first anthology of Selman-Troytt’s writing, and includes such masterpieces of prose and observation as “My First Nocturnal Emission” and “The Third Time I Soiled My Trousers”. It also features Selman-Troytt’s fascinating correspondence with Oscar Wilde, as seen above, among many other luminaries of the late Victorian age, although he rarely if ever received replies to the thousands of letters he himself sent. Selman-Troytt’s distinguished family history (he came from glass putty stock) is revealed for the first time, illuminated by a wealth of fabulous portraits. A plethora of prefaces, forewords, introductiackons, prologues, pofaces, indices, appendices, footnotes and endnotes add a final layer of relish.   >>   Phillip Barrington, the editor, resides in Bristol, from where he runs the Selman-Troytt Appreciation Society. Jeremy Selman-Troytt (1868-1916) was a Victorian colossus, a pioneer of mental and physical sexual health and a tireless recorder of physiological changes within his own body. His work was a catalyst for the sexual revolution of the 1960s, following a dark interregnum filled with austerity, sexual abstinence and international combat. Although he had no direct experience of intercourse (he was plagued with premature ejaculation, invariably climaxing weeks in advance of anticipated coition) he became an expert theorist, selflessly advising the gentry as to how congress could be negotiated with minimal shame and repugnance. Winston Churchill was an early disciple, whilst W.G. Grace never lost hope that Selman-Troytt might one day be instrumental in bringing his wife to orgasm.  &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: PHILIP BARRINGTON, the editor, resides in Bristol, from where he runs the Selman-Troytt Appreciation Society</Text>

			<Text>Is it really possible to change the structure and function of the brain, and in so doing alter how we think and feel? The answer is a resounding yes.  For decades, the conventional wisdom of neuroscience held that the hardware of the brain is fixed - that we are stuck with what we were born with. But recent pioneering experiments in neuroplasticity reveal that the brain is capable not only of altering its structure but also of generating new neurons, even into old age. The brain can adapt, heal, renew itself after trauma and compensate for disability.  In this groundbreaking book, highly respected science writer Sharon Begley documents how this fundamental paradigm shift is transforming both our understanding of the human mind and our approach to deep-seated emotional, cognitive and behavioural problems.  These breakthroughs show that it is possible to reset our happiness meter, regain the use of limbs disabled by stroke, train the mind to break cycles of depression and OCD and reverse age-related changes in the brain. SALES POINTS • A perfect introduction to the whole new concept of neuroplasticity, a revolutionary new view of how the brain works and develops. • Doing spectacularly well in the US - currently in its 10th printing and riding high on amazon.com. • Introduction from the Dalai Lama and Daniel Goleman - this is radical science presented in an accessible form for the psychology/self-help market. • Highly respected science writer will get good attention - and cause controversy - in the UK. • Practical, everyday applications for the way we live our lives ensures appeal and importance. Taps into the current thinking that ‘exercising’ your brain helps to prevent the onset of Alzheimers. PRAISE FOR THE AUTHOR “There are two great things about this book. One is that it shows us how nothing about our brains is set in stone. The other is that it is written by Sharon Begley, one of the best science writers around. This is a terrific book.” Robert Sapolsky, author of Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers 'It is very seldom that a science in its infancy is so skilfully unpacked that it reads like a detective novel' Jon Kabat-Zinn, author of Coming to Our Senses ABOUT THE AUTHOR Sharon Begley, science columnist for the Wall Street Journal and was previously the senior science writer at Newsweek. She is the co-author of The Mind and the Brain.</Text>

			<Text>Roberta Kray's first novel was published to universal acclaim: 'You might expect a crime novel written by the widow of Reggie Kray would be tough...it is. Recommend this to fans of Ian Rankin and Ken Bruen' - ("Booklist").In this third novel, there's more from the dangerous and unpredictable underworld she knows so well.Private eye Harry Lind doesn't believe in ghosts. Little Grace Harper went missing over twenty years ago, and missing girls can't just reappear - or can they? It takes a brutal murder to make him think again.Reporter Jess Vaughan is convinced that Grace is still alive but she's going to need some help to prove it. As she and Harry begin to unravel an age-old web of deceit and betrayal their discoveries soon put them on a collision course with one of London's most notorious gangsters. The search for the truth is about to lead them into a world where people will kill to preserve their secrets. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Born in Southport in 1959, Roberta Kray worked in publishing and media research in London for 15 years. In early 1996 she met Reg Kray, and they married the following year. Both her earlier novels, The Debt and The Pact are published by Constable &amp; Robertson. Her first book A Man Apart, was a biography of her husband.</Text>

			<Text>Items connected with the British military have always been extremely popular with collectors, and the intricate and beautiful badges made to denote a soldier's regiment have always been keenly collected, due to their small size, high quality and the fascinating stories of military derring-do that lie behind each one. &lt;&lt; The British army cap badge really came into beiong around the turn of the twentieth century, with large badges intended for the blue cloth helmets then in use. Later badges became smaller, and materials changed, as headgear became smaller, and new manufacturing techniques took away the laborious daily cleaning that was part of every soldier's routine for most of the century. &lt;&lt; With every regiment having numewrous variations of badge, this is a field of collecting that will yield rewards for the collector. With the aid of nearly 200 specially taken colour photographs, Arthur Ward offers a complete introduction to this topic.&lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Arthur Ward is an avid collector and author on military subjects. Arthur is the founder of www.collectingfrineds.com, an online community for collectors of toys, models &amp; militaria.&lt;&lt;SELLING POINTS: British Military badges have always been extremely popular with collectors, due to their small size, high qualityu and fascinating stories that lie behind each one. &lt;&lt; With ewvery regiment having numerous variations of badge, this is a field of collecting that will yield rewards for the collector, no matter what his budget or ambition. &lt;&lt; This book is a perfect introduction to the would-be-badge collector - it offers a close examination of a wide range of regimental cap badges and looks at cloth badges and should titles too.&lt;&lt; Superbly illustrated with 176 colour photographs. &lt;&lt; Arthur Ward is an avid collector and author on military subjects. &lt;&lt; 176 colour photographs</Text>

			<Text>The Napoleonic Wars gripped Europe, and beyond, for over ten years at the beginning of the Nineteenth century. Hundreds of battles were fought between the armies of France (and its allies) and all those powers that wished to see Napoleon Bonaparte stopped in his tracks and an end to the French Empire.  The battles and sieges of the Napoleonic Wars, which cost the lives of between 3 and 6 million men, made unprecedented use of large guns, and every participating army possessed a range of artillery. With the wars covering such a long period of time, and with so many armies involved, the subject of Napoleonic artillery is a complicated one, and no work has attempted to examine all the weapons involved in a single, detailed volume. &lt;&lt; The product of years of reasearch, this book presents most of what is known about the artillery pieces of the Naopoleonic Wars. Including numerous drawings, contemporary illustrations and modern photographs of surviving guns, it will be an invaluable addition to the library of historians, modellers, wargamers and reenactors. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Paul and Anthony Dawson and Stephen Summerfield have all written extensively on the guns of the Napoleonic Wars. Paul and Anthony live in West Yorkshire and Stephen Summerfield lives in Hull. &lt;&lt;SELLING POINTS: For the first time all the weapons involved in the Napoleonic artillery has been examined in a single detailed volume. &lt;&lt; Following years of research, this book presents most of what is known about the artillery pieces of the Napoleonic Wars. &lt;&lt; An invaluable addition to the library of historians, modellers, wargamers and re-enactors. &lt;&lt; Superbly illustrated with over 200 drawings, contemporary illustrations and modern b/w photographs. &lt;&lt;Paul and Anthony Dawson and Stephen Summerfield have spent many years researching this complicated subject of the guns of the Napoleonic Wars. &lt;&lt; 200 b/w illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Very soon after the development and popularization of the bicycle in the nineteenth century, keen cyclists realised that in order to cycle in the dark, some form of lighting was essential, both to light the way ahead, but also to alert other road users. Manufacturers were quick to respond to demand, and soon a wide range of simple lamps was available, usually fuelled by oil. But cycle lamps quickly grew in sophistication as makers tried to out-do one another with the style and efficiency of their lamps. The acetylene cycle lamps of the early part of the twentieth century are stunning examples of decorative design and manufacture.  Peter Card has been collecting early lamps, in all the bewildering varieties, for decades. This detailed book covering eighty years of cycle lamps is the result of years of reasearch.&lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Peter Card runs an auction business specializing in transport memorabilia. He has been collecting for many yaers. He is a member of the Advisory Council of the National Motor Museum. He lives in Somerset.&lt;&lt; SELLING POINTS: A detsiled and engrossing book covering the period 1868-1948; eighty years of cycle lamps from candle to batetry powered.&lt;&lt; Of great interest to anyone interested in early bicycles and transport memorabilia in genera;.&lt;&lt; 340 colour photos</Text>

			<Text>Art students and artists will be familiar with the conventional theories of colour mixing and may well have been disappointed when putting these theories into practice. In "The Colour Book", David Lloyd explains why this dissonance occurs. Using a series of step-by-step exercises, he shows the reader how to look at colour relationships in a new way that closes the gap between theory and successful practice.  Topics Covered: &lt;&lt; Shows where problems occur in colour mixing.&lt;&lt; Provides a fresh look at the key terms and concepts artists need to understand colour.&lt;&lt; Exposes the inadequacies of the traditional distinction between 'primary' and 'secondary' colours.&lt;&lt; Shows how the traditional colour wheel can be enhanced to provide a genuinely effective colour mixing tool. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: David Lloyd has sustained his practical enthusiasm in painting and drawing frim childhooh, and has more recently cultivated an interest in aesthetics and the philosophy of art. He produces work in a wide range of media, though his favoured projects are protraits. &lt;&lt;SELLING POINTS: A challenging and exciting book which shows the reader how to look at colour relationships in a new way that closes the gap between theory and successful practice. &lt;&lt; Superbly illustrated with colour photographs throughout.&lt;&lt; Aimed at art students, teachers, professional and amateur asrtists. &lt;&lt; colour throughout</Text>

			<Text>Dampness can become an enemy when it invades our interior space, when it persists, when it spreads and damages our domestic fittings, finishes and furnishings, when it encourages the growth of moulds that threaten our health, and when it stimulates the spread of fungus and decay in the structure of our houses. A major industry has developed with specialist contractors but such contractors sometimes concentrate on a single treatment rather than offering a comprehensive diagnosis.  &lt;&lt; This invaluable book provides clear information and an overview of the types and causes of dampness plus an indication of the range of treatments and remedies that are available. Superbly illustrated with approximately 150 colour drawings and photographs, The Damp House will help readers to understand and solve simple problems themselves and to evaluate solutions offered to them by professionals. &lt;&lt; Topics include: &lt;&lt; Covers rising damp, penetrating damp, condensation and leaking services in a wide range of different types of houses.  &lt;&lt; Examines damp in all parts of the house, from the roof to the walls, ceilings and floors. &lt;&lt; Considers remedying the effects of damp and living with damp&lt;&lt;    AUTHOR: Jonathan Hetreed trained as an architect at Cambridge University. He joined a firm of leading environmental architects in Bath. After twelve years as a partner in the firm, he left to establish Hetreed Ross Architects to work on medium and smaller scale projects. Around half of his work involves residential properties and the majority of these are existing and historical buildings. &lt;&lt; SELLING POINTS: Provides clear information to general readers and presents them with an overview of the types and causes of dampness, as well as to indicate the range of treatments and remedies. &lt;&lt; Aimed at all households who have damp problem, it will be of interest to most home owners, landlord, DIY enthusiasts, surveyors, architects and builders. &lt;&lt; Superbly illustrated with approx 60 colour photographs and 90 line drawings. &lt;&lt; Jonathan Hetreed is an architect with a vast experience of the subject gained over many years.&lt;&lt; 60 colour photos and 90 colour line drawings</Text>

			<Text>Kannon, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, is probably Japan's most popular Buddhist deity. (His popularity is even reflected in the brand name of the famous 'Cannon' camera) Images of Kannon - who hears the cries for help of all beings is distress - are the main focuses of worship in many Japanese temples. This exhibition catalogue presents an exceptional selection of the most beautiful sculptures and paintings from the 7th to the 14th century, some of which have never been seen before outside Japan or which are rarely accessible even to the Japanese public. Kannon takes on many different forms in order to provide assistance. Thus he may sometimes appear with eleven heads, at other times with a thousand arms, or in a pose of pure contemplation. Throughout history, the great spiritual power of this deity has continued to inspire remarkable artistic creations, from finely modelled bronzes to life-size wooden sculptures or elaborate paintings on silk. Hiroshi Sugimoto's black-and-white photographs of the thousand-armed Kannon sculptures in the famous Sanjusangen Hall in Kyoto complement these traditional works of art. &lt;&lt; 85 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Promises for the future were made; some sadly broken and some unfortunately honored. While we didn't get household jetpacks and personal serving-drinks-by-the-pool robots, or even our "orgasmatrons," we did get things like the super-fantastic building materials of the future-asbestos, lead, and foam.   So just what was the utopian master plan for future households during the early twentieth century? "Follies of Science" is the keeper of such knowledge, offering glimpses into sparkling, smooth lead paint covering our living room walls, dazzling DDT foggers killing mosquitoes dead, alchemists transforming atoms into gold and diamonds, homeowners living in "The Foam House of the Future," and, of course, commuters blasting away on their jet packs to work. Utopian indeed.   Aptly illustrated with full-color and black-and-white classic imagery, the visions of the future spread across page after page, pulling the reader in to what could have been and what shouldn't have been.  AUTHORS: Eric Dregni has written nine books, including "Midwest Marvels," "The Scooter Bible," "Ads that Put America on Wheels," and "Grazie a Dio non sono bolognese." As a 2004 Fulbright Fellow to the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, Dregni researched Scandinavian culture and roots for a forthcoming book. His time is divided between Italy, Norway, and Minneapolis where he is the curator for El Dorado Conquistador Museum and guitarist for the mock-rock trio Vinnie &amp; the Stardusters.   Jonathan Dregni is a futurist and sci-fi enthusiast, raising a family midway between the soon-to-be domed cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul Minnesota.  Colour throughout</Text>

			<Text>Emma Woodhouse had, for seventeen years and ten months, had pretty much everything in life her own way (if you overlook the death of her mother before she was out of nappies, and an unfortunate zit on her right cheek on the night of the South Downs Ball), and saw no reason at all why the situation should ever change. She was of the opinion that if you wanted something enough, you simply applied all your energies to getting it. She had no time for wimps, but she was also a caring and considerate sort of girl, well aware of her own good fortune and of her talent for getting the best out of other people. Which was why, when she met someone with untapped potential, she put all her own interests to one side and set out to change their lives for them. Whether they liked it or not.</Text>

			<Text>The first English-language book to cover the Cold War from the Soviet point of view   Western interpretations of the Cold War have hitherto erred by exaggerating either the Kremlin's pragmatism or its assertiveness. Explaining the interests, aspirations, illusions, fears and misperceptions of the Kremlin leaders and Soviet elites, Vladislav Zubok offers a Soviet perspective on the greatest stand-off of the twentieth century.  Using recently declassified Politburo records, ciphered telegrams, diaries and taped conversations, among other sources, Zubok explores the origins of the superpowers' confrontation under Stalin, Khrushchev's contradictory and counter-productive attempts to ease tensions, the surprising story of Brezhnev's passion for détente, and Gorbachev's destruction of the Soviet superpower as the by-product of his hasty steps to end the Cold War and reform the USSR.  The first work in English to cover the entire Cold War from the Soviet side, A Failed Empire provides a history different from those written by the Western victors.  'The best history we have of the Soviet side of the Cold War' William Taubman, Amherst College  'An excellent overview of Soviet foreign policy and a forceful explanation of why communism collapsed.' O. A. Westad, author of The Global Cold War</Text>

			<Text>The first detailed study of the development of radar and its crucial role in World War II   The Battle of Britain in 1940 could not have been won without radar - the towers of the Chain Home stations stand beside the Hurricanes and Spitfires as enduring symbols of Britain's "finest hour". By 1941 radar stations were controlling night fighters in the Blitz; a year later they stood sentinel against Hitler's navy and invasion fleets, and by 1943 were preparing to meet flying bombs - a threat barely conceived when research began just eight years before. Radar was a triumph of applied science and a strategic miracle; but it was also a pattern of places - a growing network of sites and stations, large and small, temporary and permanent, casting their all-seeing power over sky and sea. Building Radar is the first detailed study of the patterning and design of Britain's early-warning radar stations of the Second World War. With numerous maps and structural studies, it shows how the system was shaped by the march of war and, as it grew, provided a new focus for the talents of engineers, designers and builders. Building Radar also rediscovers the system's surviving remains, showing how sites critical to the nation's survival - and central to the history of 20th-century science - are now winning protection among our monuments of war. Drawing on extensive new research in wartime papers, Building Radar is the latest in Colin Dobinson's Monuments of War series arising from his work for English Heritage in their Monuments Protection programme.   About Colin Dobinson  Dr Colin Dobinson was born in 1960 in East Sussex. After studying archaeology at York and Cambridge he joined the Council for British Archaeology. The series Monuments of War arises from his work for English Heritage in their Monuments Protection Programme. He lives near Leyburn, North Yorkshire and his other work includes Fields of Deception: Britain's Bombing Decoys of World War II</Text>

			<Text>The first full-length history of Britain's anti-aircraft defences during the Second World War, and of their surviving remains   'The bomber,' said Stanley Baldwin in 1932, 'will always get through'. AA Command is the story of one attempt to prove a politician wrong. Drawing upon a wealth of original documents and first-hand accounts, it tells the story of Britain's anti-aircraft defences on the home front during the Second World War: In the Battle of Britain, the Blitz, and the Luftwaffe's cruel campaigns against cathedral cities and coastal resorts.  And it does more... Originally commissioned to support English Heritage's initiatives to preserve England's wartime remains, AA Command is also a study of the everyday places where the battle was fought. Thousands of gun batteries were built during the war. By exploring their design and patterning, AA Command offers a new perspective on Britain's defence geography and rediscovers the sites that were home to hundreds of men – and women.  About Colin Dobinson  Dr Colin Dobinson was born in 1960 in East Sussex. After studying archaeology at York and Cambridge he joined the Council for British Archaeology.

			<Text>Astonishing new history of a little-known and strikingly unusual subject by the acclaimed author of The Pirate Wars    Treasure Hunt is the story of a national obsession. Dreams of Spanish treasure, of unearned gold at the bottom of the sea, have been a part of the English psyche since long before effective diving equipment was invented. In 1687 Captain William Phips weighed anchor in English waters with an incredible cargo – nearly forty tons of silver and gold, the treasure of the Spanish galleon Concepción, wrecked over forty years before on a coral reef in the middle of the ocean. This treasure in coins and bullion had been raised by naked divers, unaided by breathing equipment. The great British treasure-hunting boom had begun.   Over the next two hundred years, many such adventures, most based on extremely dubious information, were begun, with many fortunes and lives lost in the process. The real boom for underwater treasure hunting took place in the 1690s, with the invention of crude, very dangerous diving equipment. And, with the advent of the stock market, gambling and treasure-hunting became closely connected to the birth of modern capitalism.  In the 18th and 19th centuries treasure hunting became a professional occupation, with a new breed of diver emerging to salvage the wrecks of English and Dutch East-Indiamen carrying treasure to finance purchases in Asia. World-renowned naval historian Peter Earle returns with an extraordinary and little-known history of a peculiarly English phenomenon – of outstanding bravery, of exceptional recklessness, and above all, of dreams of treasure. About Peter Earle  Peter Earle is Emeritus Reader in Economic History at the University of London. He has written widely on many subjects and his books include A City Full of People, The Making of the Middle Class, The World of Defoe and Monmouth's Rebels.</Text>

			<Text>The trail of a recent crime leads Inspector DeKok to Bloedberg (Blood Mountain), Belgium, a neighborhood in Antwerp. It seems a man was fished from the Scheldt River, and DeKok has been summoned to help with the investigation.  At a funeral back in Amsterdam, things are just as murky as the corpse's river when DeKok discovers a man among the mourners who has been officially dead for at least two years. Events further darken DeKok's view of the case when the widow of the recently buried victim files a complaint of forgery; her deceased husband's bank account has been emptied.  DeKok soon finds himself drawn back to Bloedberg, amidst one of the most bizarre and cunning crime syndicates the old, gray sleuth has faced yet.  A.C. Baantjer is the most widely read author in the Netherlands. A former detective inspector of the Amsterdam police, his fictional characters reflect the depth and personality of individuals encountered during his thirty-eight-year career in law enforcement. He was recently knighted by the Dutch monarchy. About the Author Baantjer is the most widely read author in the Netherlands.

More specifically, this latter section considers the physical impact of the JEwish presence in Polsih towns - in general, and in Gora Kalwaria, home to the Gerer hasidic dynasty. It includes a map of synogogue buildings still standing in 1988 and an inventory showing teir current use, and an illustrated on recent Jewish monuments in Warsaw. Several of the remaining articles relate to Polish or Yiddish literature. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Antony Polonsky holds the Albert Abramson Chair of Holocaust Studies at Brandeis University and the United States Holocaust Memorail Museum in Washington DC.  &lt;&lt;&lt; 20 pages of plates</Text>

			<Text>With his striking and dominant stick figures, Keith Haring emerged as the shooting star of the New York art scene in the '80s. His images, which range from comical to socially and politically critical, exude an energy and dynamic that is fascinating and universal today. Especially Haring's sketches demonstrate his ability to create powerful statements with clear-cut lines and reduced figures. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Beate Reifenscheid-ronnisch is the director of the Ludwig Museum in Koblenz, Germany.  &lt;&lt; 130 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>From her earliest works, in which she posed taxidermized sparrows in knitted garments, to her magnificent three-room installation, "Casino", which won her the Golden Lion awad at the 2005 Venice Biennale, Annette MEssager has long tackled issues of femininity, prejudice, social mores, birth, and death. &lt;&lt; Illustrated with more than 600 images that track her entire career to date, this book designed by the artist herself includes interviews, texts y the artist, sketches, installations and photographs of her work. &lt;&lt; Messager's work encompasses the highly personal, such as ink blots made from her own signatures, diary entries, her children's drawings, to the political, for example effigies displaying acts of torture and abuse. She employs a wide range of materials, including fabric, wool, found objects, personal sketches and photography, through which she catalogues and mines these themes. As varied as its subject, this beautifully produced volume demonstrates Messager's powerful ability to transform the stuff of life into objects of potent expression. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Annette Messager has worked in paitning, sculpture, assemblage, video, photography, film, embroidery and installation since the 1960s. She has exhibited around the world, including Saint Louis Art Museum, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of MOdern Art in New York, Museo de Arte Moderno in Buenos Aires, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris.  &lt;&lt; 650 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Many myths surround the "hyena Men" who haunt the peripheries of Nigeria's cities. Accompanied by hyenas, rock pythons and baboons, these men earn a living by performing before crowds and selling traditonal medicines. Pieter Hugo's extraordinary portraits of their liminal existence reveal an uncanny world of complex, co-dependent relationships, where familiar distinctions between dominance and submission, wildness and domesticity, tradition and modernity are constantly subverted. Nigerian journalist Adetokunbo Abiola introduces readers to the "Hyena Men", explaining the traditions and mystique behind their practices. Presented inn thirty-five full colour plates, these intense portraits reveal why Hugo is one of the most exciting young photographers at work today. &lt;&lt; AUTHOR: Pieter Hugo is a photographer whose work has been shown in his native South Africa as well as throughout Europe and North America. Hugo won first prize in the Portraits section of the 2006 World Press Photo competition, and was selected by Getty Images as one of their Young Photographers of 2006.  &lt;&lt; 35 colour illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Its France, 1761. Beyond the glittering court of Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour at Versailles, lies Paris, a capital in the grip of crime and immorality ...A police officer disappears and Nicolas Le Floch, a young recruit to the force, is instructed to find him. When unidentified human remains suddenly come to light, he seems to have a murder investigation on his hands. As the city descends into Carnival debauchery, Le Floch will need all his skill, courage and integrity to unravel a mystery which threatens to implicate the highest in the land. This is the first in a series of six historical crime novels which has sold in excess of 400,000 copies in French. The author brings eighteenth century Paris vividly to life and the story features real-life characters Madame de Pompadour and Loius XV as well as engaging hero Nicolas le Floch. It is soon to be adapted for French Television.  AUTHOR: Jean-Francois Parot is a Diplomat, currently French ambassador to an African country. He is also an historian specialising in 18th century Paris. He lives in a chateau on the Loire.&lt;&lt; REVIEW: 'Jean-Francois Parot's evocation of the eighteenth century Paris is richly imagined and full of fascinating historical snippets...the first in a promising series of French period mysteries, and if the other titles are half as good as this one, they will certainly be worth looking out for'. The Mail on Sunday.&lt;&lt; 'Has all the twists, turns and surprises the genre demands'. The Independent on Sunday&lt;&lt; 'A terrific debut...brilliantly evokes the casual brutality of a life in eighteenth-century France'. The Sunday Times.&lt;&lt; SELLING POINTS: Fist in series of six historical ccrime novels.&lt;&lt; Series has sold 400,000 copies in French.&lt;&lt; Reads like a cross between a Maigret Mystery and Les Liaisons Dangereuses. &lt;&lt; Bribgs 18th century Paris vividly to life and features real-life characters Madame de Pompadour and Louis XV.&lt;&lt;Soon to be adapted for French television.</Text>

			<Text>Today's premier hotels have evolved into complex organisms that prompt a variety of different ways of addressing the rising expectations of the clientele, and each new design seeks to establish a unique figurative and semantic image. The interiors presented in this book offer a broad and complex panorama in which projects that reinterpret the idea of luxury coexist with others that elaborate entirely novel blueprints and types of comfort. Consequently, we see fully customized architecture vying with refurbished existing buildings in close relationship with the uniquely Italian context of fine historical buildings and superb landscapes.    Selection of the most architecturally interesting hotels in Italy. &lt;&lt; Fully illustrated with designers, technical data and materials of each project.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Text in English and Italian &lt;&lt;&lt; 310 colour &amp; 30 b/w illustrations</Text>

They help visitors to understand and appreciate important aspects of our natural and cultural heritage. But to do this they need to be designed in an effective, user-friendly way.   This comprehensive guide provides a series of principles and guidelines for effective sign design, with instruction based on research, the latest in educational and psychological theory, real world examples, and practical guidelines. A must-read for interpreters, Designing Interpretative Signs includes valuable information about choosing sign locations, attracting and keeping visitors' attention, organizing information so that visitors can easily follow it, and evaluating and improving signs for a wide range of sites.

			<Text>Scores of American women are leading double lives. By day they are librarians, financial analysts, bartenders, teachers, and even mothers; by night their athletic alter egos assume their authority with monikers such as Helen Wheels, Dirty Britches, Anna Mosity, and Assaultin' Pepa. They lace up their skates, slide into racy racing uniforms, and adorn a full set of protective gear. One of America's greatest sports is back-roller derby.   In Roller Derby, readers will encounter roller derby in its various incarnations, from the original Depression-era games through the days of Roller Jam to its current revival.   What started as a dance-a-thon-style test of endurance has evolved into a unique sport that exemplifies point-scoring, body-checking, speed, blood, punches, and miles and miles of personality and style. Punctuated throughout the book are derby vignettes: stories from old-school and new-school girls, the process of selecting a derby name and style, the artistic element to logos and uniforms, so-gruesome-you-just-have-to-look injuries, what's legal during a bout and-more importantly-what's not, and much more.   Encircling the story of roller derby are vintage promo paraphernalia and histori-cal photographs, as well as stunning, full-color and black-and-white, modern-day shots of the women, the bouts, and the sport.  AUTHOR: Catherine Mabe (a.k.a Jayne Manslauhgter) is a founding member of the Rocky Mountain Rollergilrs, one of the nation's modern-day, flat-track roller derby leagues. She is first and foremost a skater but has also served as director of recruitment and public relations, as well as Girl Friday for the league since its inception. Mabe's knowledge and understanding of roller derby's past plus her own immersion in the game's future provides a unique look at a truly unique sport.</Text>

			<Text>"Scooters" tells the story of the scooters' transition from a practical, efficient workhorse to a counter-cultural catalyst. The Scootering hobby blends a healthy obsession for things mechanical with a distinct taste for the unusual. "Scooters" offers an insiders' look at the massive growth of the avocation in North America since the mid 1980's and explores the diversity of characters that make up the scooter scene. Filled with photographs and revving with color and personality, this wonderful book takes the reader along to the rally and should prove revealing and entertaining to those involved in Scootering and those who simply appreciate what it means to love and ride a work of art. Invented in America and perfected in Europe, the scooter became a critical component in post-war reconstruction on the continent. Out-of-work munitions and aircraft factories churned out the user-friendly two wheelers as a boost to manufacturing and a way of providing inexpensive transportation capable of traversing a beleaguered infrastructure. Two key Italian marques, "Vespa" and "Lambretta," lead a wave of stylish offerings from across Europe and created instant fan fare. Enthusiasm for the machine was such that scooter clubs were formed almost as quickly as the first models rolled off of the assembly lines. Competitive scooter riding events soon followed, and, in their heyday, scooters gave motorcycles a run for their money both on the racetrack and in showrooms. Colin Shattuck is an active and well-traveled Scooterist involved in DCD, a Denver coalition of Scooter Clubs dedicated to hosting the annual Mile-High Mayhem Rally, one of the most heavily attended in North America. Shattuck is alsoco-founder of Sportique Scooters, a small chain of Scooter Shops based in Colorado.   AUTHORS: Colin Shattuck is an active and well-traveled scooterist involved in DCD, a Denver coalition of Scooter Clubs dedicated to hoisting the annual Mile High Mayhem Rally, one of the most heavily attended in North America. &lt;&lt; Eric Peterson is a Denver-based freelance writer. His books include Frommer's Montane &amp; Wyoming, Roadside Americana, and The Great American Road Trip. When not pecking away at a keyboard, Peterson is often hiking, biking, or wandering with his faithful mutt Giblet.</Text>

			<Text>$136 million for a Klimt, $71.7 million for an Andy Warhol...It's not that art is expensive, but rather that money has become cheap for certain collectors—Russian oligarchs, Chinese, and American hedge-fund managers. Collections are being redistributed to new fortunes around the world. Sophisticated marketing campaigns, the most luxurious parties, a new wealthy elite passionate about art cross paths to compete for paintings now considered trophies. At present, details like "who's selling what" and "which auction house is organizing the sale" play an important role in sums fetched. The goal is paradoxical: always pay more. Worth of Art (2) offers an inside and outside view on an art world nourished by excess.   After studying international law and political science, journalist Judith Benhamou-Huet became an expert in the art market. She pens the weekly column on the subject at Échos and at Le Point, as well as a monthly column for ArtPress. She has compiled several large reports on art for Art &amp; Auction, the Swiss daily Neue Zurcher Zeitung, the magazine Beaux-Arts and Vogue France. She has organized many symposiums on the art market, most recently in Shangai, addressing business men as art collectors.The editor of Elle Accessories, Kelly Killoren Bensimon is also the author of American Style and In the Spirit of the Hamptons at Assouline Publishing.   144 pages 15 illustrations hardcover   6.4 x 9.4"</Text>

			<Text>30 Color Photographs  Film and Television  The Newmarket Shooting Script® Series      The official screenplay book tie-in to the delightful romantic comedy starring Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche, coming from Touchstone Pictures and Focus Features, directed by Peter Hedges (Pieces of April).  Synopsis  Something's happening to Dan.  It's confusing.  It's awkward.  It's family.     It all begins with widowed father and family advice columnist Dan Burns (comic sensation Steve Carell), who is still reeling from the heartache of loss and takes refuge by trying to maintain order with his three rebellious young girls, while dodging anything unexpected or outside the box. But when Dan heads to Rhode Island, his miffed daughters in tow, for the annual Fall weekend thrown by the large and boisterous Burns family, everything changes. Soon after his arrival, he runs into an alluring woman named Marie (Academy Award winner Juliette Binoche) in a bookshop. For the first time in a very, very long time, Dan experiences real, live sparks—only to have to douse them liberally when he discovers Marie is, in fact, the brand-new girlfriend his brother Mitch (stand-up comic star Dane Cook) is about to proudly introduce to the family.      As the weekend gets under way in the close quarters of a crowded house filled with quirky, prying relatives, Dan and Marie try to squelch and cover up their growing mutual attraction at every turn, leading to one comical situation after another. Yet, no matter how hard they try to do the very opposite, Dan and Marie can't help but fall in love. Now Dan is about to realize that no matter how wise safety might seem, when it comes to real life, he's going to have to break all the rules.       In addition to the script, this Newmarket Shooting Script® book includes a foreword by Pierce Gardner, an introduction and scene notes by Peter Hedges, a color photo section, and complete cast and crew credits.   Reviews  "Funny and emotional without any of the sentimental shorthand found in most romantic comedies...Hedges' screenplay, co-written by Pierce Gardner, is close to perfection, and he brings it home with truthful performances and camerawork that's tasteful and psychologically astute... One of the half-dozen best American films so far this year." Mike LaSalle, San Francisco Chronicle    "Blissfully funny and touching... Seeing the name of Iowa writer Peter Hedges on a movie (What?s Eating Gilbert Grape, About a Boy, Pieces of April) means you're in for a unique blend of humor and heartbreak, with the bruising and healing powers of family right at the core... Dan in Real Life [is] the real thing in romantic comedy in that its characters manage to be romantic, hilarious and recognizably human at the same time." Peter Travers, Rolling Stone    "Hedges, a seasoned screenwriter, showed in his directorial debut, Pieces of April, that he could infuse tired conventions of domestic comedy with fresh life and real intelligence. And here, working in a less self-consciously eccentric mode, he does it again... Dan in Real Life does not strain after big conceptual jokes, but rather finds humor in things people might actually say. The characters are funny not just to us but to each other. Like most people, they use humor as a means of communication and self-defense, which gives the movie a genial, unhurried, lived-in feeling." A.O. Scott, New York Times    "As his work testifies, Hedges specializes in reality-based comedy with a hidden heart. Determined, he has said, 'not to take shortcuts with people,' Hedges doesn't let humor interfere with emotional complexity. He sees his characters' flaws but, in an attitude we could all emulate, adopts a tolerant, accepting attitude towards them." Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times</Text>

			<Text>30 Color Photographs  Film and Television  The Newmarket Shooting Script® Series       From Academy Award®?nominated writer/director Noah Baumbach (The Squid and the Whale, Kicking and Screaming), the official screenplay book tie-in to the critically acclaimed movie coming from Paramount Vantage, starring Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jack Black, and John Turturro.   Synopsis   Noah Baumbach's follow-up to his Academy Award®-nominated The Squid and the Whale is a daringly funny and bracingly honest exploration of the tender, absurd, and sometimes excruciating relationship between siblings and the fallout for those in their wake: children, husbands, lovers.      Margot Zeller (Academy Award® winner Nicole Kidman), a savagely bright, razor-tongued short-story writer who creates chaos wherever she goes, sets off on a surprise journey to the wedding of her estranged and free-spirited, unassuming sister Pauline (Golden Globe® nominee Jennifer Jason Leigh). Margot, with her all-too-rapidly maturing son Claude (newcomer Zane Pais) in tow, arrives with the gale force of a hurricane. From the minute she meets Pauline's fianc?—the unemployed artist Malcolm (Jack Black)—Margot starts to plant seeds of doubt about the union.      As the wedding approaches, one complication crashes into the next: vengeful neighbors, a beloved tree in the backyard, and Margot's own marital turmoil. The two sisters find themselves at the precipice of an unexpected transformation ultimately revealing that even when your family is about to implode . . . the one thing you can cling to for solace and comfort is your imploding family.      In addition to the complete script, this Newmarket Shooting Script® book includes an exclusive introduction by biographer Patricia Bosworth, an exclusive Q&amp;A with Baumbach, a color photo section, and the complete cast and crew credits.   Reviews  "The laughs come fast and furious in Noah Baumbach's Margot at the Wedding, and they're sharp enough to draw blood. Nicole Kidman gives her best and riskiest performance in years as Margot, a high-strung writer visiting the Hamptons with her son Claude (Zane Pais), for the wedding of her sister Pauline (a pitch-perfect Jennifer Jason Leigh). The result is comic devastation. You won't know what hit you." Peter Travers, Rolling Stone</Text>

			<Text>The official screenplay book tie-in to the highly acclaimed movie from Fox Searchlight Pictures, written by Diablo Cody (author if Candy Girl) and directed by Jason Reitman (Thank You for Smoking), tells the story of a confidently frank teenage girl who calls the shots with a nonchalant cool and an effortless attitude as she journeys through an emotional nine-month adventure into adulthood.  Synopsis  While most girls at Dancing Elk are updating their MySpace page or shopping at the mall, Juno is a whip-smart Minnesota teen living by her own rules. A typically boring afternoon becomes anything but when Juno decides to have sex with the charmingly unassuming Bleeker (Michael Cera). Faced with an unplanned pregnancy, she and best friend Leah (Olivia Thirlby) hatch a plan to find Juno's unborn baby the perfect set of parents courtesy of the local Penny Saver. They set their sights on Mark and Vanessa Loring (Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner), an affluent suburban couple who are longing to adopt their first child. Luckily, Juno has the support of her dad and stepmother (J.K. Simmons and Allison Janney). After the initial shock that their daughter has been sexually active with the unlikely "virile" Bleeker, the family bands together to help Juno. Dad Mac accompanies Juno to size up the prospective adoptive parents to make sure they are not a couple of "wing nuts" while stepmother Bren provides emotional support as Juno fights the prejudices of underage pregnancy. As Juno moves closer and closer to her due date, the veneer of Mark and Vanessa's idyllic life starts to show signs of cracking. While fall becomes winter and winter turns to spring, Juno's physical changes mirror her personal growth. With a fearless intellect far removed from the usual teen angst, Juno conquers her problems head-on, displaying a youthful exuberance both smart and unexpected.      In addition to the complete script, this Newmarket Shooting Script® book includes a foreword by director Jason Reitman, an exclusive introduction by Diablo Cody, a color photo section, and the complete cast and crew credits.     Reviews  "A fresh, unusually intelligent comedy with dialogue so quick and funny you feel the actors are performing it on a high wire." Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times    "Juno boasts some of the most viciously sarcastic dialogue since Heathers." Joshua Rothkopf, Time Out New York    "A funny, savvy, feel-good comedy that defies expectations at every turn." Kirk Honeycutt, The Hollywood Reporter</Text>

			<Text>8 Color Photographs  Film and Television  The Newmarket Shooting Script® Series      From writer/director Tamara Jenkins (The Slums of Beverly Hills) and starring Laura Linney, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Philip Bosco, the official screenplay book tie-in to the movie from Fox Searchlight Pictures that takes an irreverent look at family, love, and mortality.  Synopsis  The last thing the two Savage siblings ever wanted to do was look back at their difficult family history. Having wriggled their way out from beneath their father's domineering thumb, they are now firmly cocooned in their own complicated lives. Wendy (Academy Award® nominee Laura Linney) is a struggling East Village playwright, aka a temp who spends her days applying for grants, stealing office supplies, and dating her very married neighbor. Jon (Academy Award® winner Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a neurotic college professor writing books on obscure subjects in Buffalo. Then comes the call that informs them that the father they have long feared and avoided, Lenny Savage (Tony Award® winner Philip Bosco), is slowly being consumed by dementia and they are the only ones who can help.      Now, as they put their already arrested lives on hold, Wendy and Jon are forced to live together under one roof for the first time since childhood, rediscovering the eccentricities that drove each other crazy. Faced with complete upheaval and battling over how to handle their father's final days, they are confronted with what adulthood, family, and, most surprisingly, each other are really about.    In addition to the complete script, this Newmarket Shooting Script® book includes an exclusive introduction by Tamara Jenkins, a color photo section, and the complete cast and crew credits.     Reviews  "Prickly humor, strong writing, excellent direction and magnificent acting...The Savages is note perfect." Patrick Z.

			<Text>30 Color Photographs  Film and Television  The Newmarket Shooting Script® Series      The official screenplay book tie-in to the hilarious slacker comedy from Universal Pictures by Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Freaks and Geeks) about a very unexpected pregnancy.  Synopsis  They say that opposites attract.  For slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) and career girl Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), that's certainly the case--at least for one intoxicated evening.  Two months and several pregnancy tests later, Ben and Alison go through a hysterically funny, anxious, and heartwarming journey that leads to huge laughs.  Featuring the complete script, plus commentary by filmmaker Judd Apatow and actress Charlyne Yi (who plays Jodi in the movie), stills from the film, full cast and crew credits, and an article by Sarah Vance that appeared in Script magazine, this Newmarket Shooting Script book will be irresistible to the growing legion of Judd Apatow fans.  "For a long time, I thought you needed a big, high-concept idea or an intricate plot.  But now I think that if I'm really honest, any idea can be funny and interesting, especially if I'm not afraid to go all the way with a confessional style." --Judd Apatow  Reviews  "Judd Apatow is making the freshest, most honest mainstream comedies in Hollywood...uproariously funny." David Ansen, Newsweek    "Knocked Up strikes me as an instant classic, a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment without straining, pandering or preaching." A.O. Scott, New York Times    "Knocked Up is uproarious.  Line for line, minute to minute, writer-director Judd Apatow's latest effort is more explosively funny, more frequently, than nearly any other major studio release in recent memory." Joe Leyden, Variety</Text>

			<Text>108 Color Photographs  Film and Television      Covering all four seasons--the only book on the hit television show starring Denis Leary about the professional and personal lives of New York City firefighters, acclaimed by critics and viewers alike.  Synopsis  Rescue Me, the highly praised, groundbreaking drama that has attracted millions of viewers a week, revolves around the lives of the men in a New York City firehouse in a post-9/11 world.  Each week, compelling storylines tackle the daily drama of the life-and-death situations associated with being a firefighter, while exploring the ways they use dark humor to protect their true emotions.  The men of Rescue Me (the crew of 62 Truck) are Tommy Gavin (Leary), Mike Silletti (Mike Lombardi), Chief Jerry Reilly (Jack McGee), Sean Garrity (Steven Pasquale), Kenny "Lou" Shea (John Scurti), and Franco Rivera (Daniel Sunjata).  This full-color companion guide provides an insider's look at the first four seasons of this Emmy-nominated series including:      *Uncensored sript excerpts featuring memorable, scintillating, and (almost always      politically incorrect dialogue      *A hilarious preface by Denis Leary and Peter Tolan about the creation of the     series      *More than 140 provocative photographs of the men (and the women who love them) of 62 Truck      *An extensive episode guide detailing every show in the past four seasons and       including playlists of the music from each episode  Beginning with the lyrics to the Von Bondies' "C'mon, C'mon" (which opens every episode), the book is divided into seven parts, each representing a major ongoing theme of the series including: The Job; Talking About the Bitch; The Homo Stuff; Love, Marriage...Blah...Blah...Blah; Family; Religion; and Ghosts and Heroes.  Reviews  "Thrillingly raw...Scathingly funny...Rescue Me is bound to haunt you." New York Daily News    "It's not a nice show, but it's so damn good...Co-creator Denis Leary has invented simply one of the best characters on TV as rageful, prideful, ammonia-tongued firefighter Tommy Gavin." Entertainment Weekly</Text>

			<Text>80 Color Photographs  Film and Television/Newmarket Pictorial Moviebooks      In time for the holidays, the only official book tie-in to the hilarious blockbuster film, including the complete screenplay, movie stills, and outrageous drawings that millions of fans will recognize from the film.  Synopsis  From producers Judd Apatow and Shauna Robertson (The 40-Year-Old Virgin), screenwriters Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, and director Greg Mottola comes Superbad, a coming-of-age cautionary tale about two socially inept teenage boys about to graduate high school. Theirs is a ridiculously dependent friendship—but now they've gotten into different colleges and are forced to contemplate life apart. Evan (Michael Cera) is sweet, smart, and generally terrified. Seth (Jonah Hill) is foul-mouthed, volatile, and all-consumed with the topic of human sexuality. They are joined by their nerdy pal Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), whose fake ID as "McLovin" sets everything into motion. This is the story of their misguided attempts to reverse a lifelong losing streak with the ladies in one panic-driven night...that awful, humiliating night you cherish for the rest of your life.       Exclusive to this must-have companion book:           Introduction by producer Judd Apatow        "Mr. Vagtastic's Guide to Buying Porn"       Hilarious captioned drawings by David Goldberg        The film's complete script        Full cast and crew credits   Also included is a section of commentaries and reviews from:        Rolling Stone (Peter Travers)        New York magazine (David Edelstein)        Entertainment Weekly (Josh Rottenberg)        The New York Times (Michael Cieply)   Reviews  "Superbad might be the most provocative teen sex comedy ever made; it is certainly one of the most convulsively funny." David Edelstein, New York magazine    "Wide-eyed and sincere as its hilarity, unrepentantly profane, the movie aims to express what it's like to stare down the barrel of your first foray into adulthood, and it's not afraid to be honest about it." Carina Chocano, Los Angeles Times</Text>

			<Text>The official screenplay book tie-in to the hit thriller from Warner Bros., starring Academy Award® winner George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton, and Sydney Pollack, and written and directed by Tony Gilroy (The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy).   Synopsis   Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is an in-house "fixer" at one of the largest corporate law firms in New York. A former criminal prosecutor, Clayton takes care of Kenner, Bach &amp; Ledeen?s dirtiest work at the behest of the firm's co-founder Marty Bach (Sydney Pollack). Though burned out and hardly content with his job, his divorce, a failed business venture, and mounting debt have left Clayton inextricably tied to the firm. At the agrichemical company U/North, meanwhile, the career of in-house counsel Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) rests on the multimillion-dollar settlement of a class action suit that Clayton's firm is leading to a seemingly successful conclusion. But when Kenner Bach's brilliant and guilt-ridden attorney Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) sabotages the U/North case, Clayton faces the biggest challenge of his career and his life.      The Newmarket Shooting Script® book includes the complete script, an exclusive foreword by William Goldman, a Q&amp;A with writer/director Tony Gilroy, a color photo section, and the complete cast and crew credits.   Reviews  "When critics complain about the dumbing down of movies into franchise popcorn, what we're really doing is yearning for a terrifically engrossing, tethered-to-the-real-world drama like Michael Clayton. It's better than good: it's such a crackling and mature and accomplished movie that it just about restores your faith." Owen Gleiberman, Entertainment Weekly    "This is unequivocally a thriller for adults. A deftly written, tautly suspenseful and intellectually demanding morality tale, it stays a step ahead of the audience and features multidimensional characters played by actors at the top of their games." Claudia Puig, USA Today    "After what must seem like a lifetime of writing screenplays for other people to direct, Tony Gilroy has come out from behind the curtain. With the George Clooney-starring Michael Clayton, he's not only saved his best script for himself, he's also turned out a smart and suspenseful legal thriller that comes completely alive on-screen" Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times</Text>

			<Text>Re-issed for 2007, Bugatti - The Man and the Marque is a rigorously researched and definitive book - the first major re-appraisal of artist engineer Ettore Bugatti and his extraordinary cars to appear since 1963. He built only 7,800 cars between 1910 and 1939, but these are much sought-after today.  This book charts the beginnings of the famous marque, the cars that brought it fame from the exquisite Type 35 to the massive Royale, only six of which were ever built, and chronicles the make's revival which began in Italy in 1988.  Comprehensively illustrated with over 300 photographs, this book is a unique source of reference and winner of the Society of Automotive Historians' Cugnot Award.  "...likely to become the standard work...highly recommended." The Automobile "...one of the most readable volumes of the year. The artistic background inwhich Ettore grew up is laid out in scholarly detail." Motor Sport.</Text>

			<Text>For most of us, the biggest asset we have is our home. The best way to protect that asset is to keep it in good condition. Australian Maintaining Your Home is a crucial first investment in ensuring you optimise the condition and value of your home. Australian Maintaining Your Home is similar to a recipe book, except that, instead of baking, it describes the basics of keeping your home in top condition. You are given the tools to assess parts of the house, identify what has caused problems or deterioration and then guidance on how to fix it. This book also advises homeowners about do-it-yourself work that can be carried out. Many maintenance and repair jobs can be done by you, but specialist help is indicated where this is required. Australian Maintaining Your Home also gives some advice on dealing with weathertightness issues. This is also more than a book for do-it-yourselfers—anyone who wants to protect their valuable asset will find helpful information about staying on top of common issues that confront all homeowners.</Text>

			<Text>l Although he is best known for his Expressionist portraits and landscapes, Oskar Kokoschka was passionate about music and dedicated many works to this theme l Kokoschka's writings included here were discovered only at the beginning of the nineties and are still relatively unknown l The book will appeal to art historians, students, set designers, and possibly musicians The Austrian painter Oskar Kokoschka (1886-1980) was closely linked to his country's musical tradition, in particular to the Viennese composers Schonberg, Berg, and Webern. His friends included the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler, and the musicians Richter, Serkin, Menuhin and Casals. In his autobiography, Kokoschka declared that he "had closer relationships with contemporary musicians than with painters or writers". With his masterly painting The Power of Music (1918-20) Kokoschka entered the debate on musical dissonance, tonality and chromatic harmony, evoking a "music of colors". This book focuses on the artist's music-inspired works and presents Kokoschka's favourite theme: the effects of music on the human soul. It also includes never-published-before extracts from the countless correspondences between the artist and his musician friends. Text in English and French. Dominique Radrizzani is Director of the Musée Jenisch,Vevey. Régine Bonnefoit is an art historian and curator of the Oskar Kokoschka Foundation, Musée Jenisch,Vevey. Ruth Häusler is curator of the manuscript department at the Bibliothèque Centrale in Zurich.</Text>

			<Text>This book tells the story of a successful, ground-breaking, range of sporting Ford cars. From 1969, when the 'Car You Always Promised Yourself' was introduced, and for nearly twenty years after that, the Capri range set new engineering, styling and marketing standards. In that period, nearly two million Capris were sold, and Ford's rivals struggled to match it.  Graham Robson's affectionate narrative covers the complete history of these versatile machines - not only in the showrooms and in the marketplace, but on the race tracks where so many successes were gained. &lt;&lt;AUTHOR: Graham Robson has not only been involved in the motor industry for half a century - but he has  come to learn, more and more, about every aspect of Ford in the Uk and Europe. Graham has now written more important automotive titles than any other motoring historian; several of them published by The Crowood Press. &lt;&lt;SELLING POINTS: The complete story of the Ford Capri, a successful, ground-breaking range of sporting Ford cars. &lt;&lt; Not only covers the technical and marketing story but also that of the people, the personalities and world events which affected their careers. &lt;&lt; Graham Robson has been involved in the motor industry as a writer, road tester and historical consultant for more than half a century as is known by many of Ford's top men. &lt;&lt; 237 colour &amp; b/w photos</Text>

			<Text>What are the names of all those delicious apples that are often sold unlabeled at fruit and vegetable markets or that are piled up in all colours and shapes in the display cases at the entrance to the supermarket? - and you wonder which types originally gave rise to various hybrids. Trying to distinguish between the many varieties of blue-mould cheese takes more time than the lay-person’s patience will allow.  The well structured and highly informative reference book Ingredients provides help with all of these questions, identifies approximately 2000 ingredients by name and describes their composition and uses. This book will help cooks—and everyone who likes to eat—find their way through the world’s jungle of ingredients.</Text>

			<Text>The glamour of the 30s and the extremes of the 80s, from the corsets of the belle epoque to the caftans of the 70s, this book presents an impressive array of images depicting the world of fashion in the twentieth century.

Even political events have repercussions for fashion, and this book places many fashion fads in their historical context. Decades of Fashion has captured the realm of fashion in hundreds of photographs that show not only designer creations on the catwalk, but also everyday style.

			<Text>Also known as Fiorenza, Florence in Italian is Florentia, the "flowering" city. Under the Medici family in the 15th century, such artists as Leonardo da Vinci, Botticelli and Brunelleschi turned the city into an artistic centre and awakened Italian humanism.

Such was its status that Pope Bonifatius VIII believed the city should be considered a fifth element—water, earth, air, fire, and Florence. This guide takes modern visitors to such timeless destinations as the Dome of Santa Maria del Fiore, the Piazza della Signora, and the treasures of the Galleria degli Uffizi. Compact enough to take on a tour, these pleasingly chunky art books focus on a particular city or region, presenting outstanding examples of the art and architecture found there.

This book offers a quick orientation and art historical explanations, colour photographs of the works discussed, essays on history and culture, town maps and ground plans with thumbnail views, an illustrated time chart, and a guide to architectural styles. 14.6 x 16.3  x 3 cm 560 pages Colour photos throughout</Text>

			<Text>The World Contemporary Architecture – Architects have been accused of only looking at the pictures in books. Architecture is matter and lives from the visible, from reconfigured room constellations, from overcoming gravity, from materials and their surfaces. This opulently illustrated book allows the reader to see from the perspective of an architect. To help the observer combine the contents of the individual photos into buildings in their mind’s eye, detailed floor plans are provided for each image. 2,000 illustrations</Text>

			<Text>Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes of Greece open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.  Those who seek out the land of the Greeks with their souls also like to nourish their bodies à la Greek. In the homeland of Homer, Sophocles, and Plato, where historical-cultural treasures and Mediterranean flair are part of everyday life, the love of good food is an integral element of the culture. This volume of Culinaria leads us from the banquet tables of ancient symposia to the sophisticated arrangements of haute cuisine in the metropolises as well as the simpler fare enjoyed by fishermen, farming families, and shepherds. Naturally, wine, olives, sheep’s cheese, fish, and fruits play an important role in Greek dishes. This sensual journey across the mainland and the islands provides a view behind the scenes of Greek culinary culture for fans of this country, in which the Orthodox Eastern celebration is just one of the highlights. More than 1,300 colored illustrations on 460 pages as well as  Numerous authentic recipes make even reading this book an experience for the palate. The Author Marianthi Milona was born in 1965 in Thessaloniki and studied German, English, and Greek philology in Cologne. Since 1990, she has been a journalist for regional, national, and international radio and print media. Because of her in-depth knowledge of Greece and the Balkans, she regularly makes extended research trips to all the important areas of southeast Europe.  Photographer: Werner Stapelfeldt began his career as a photographer for travel guides and magazines. After studying photo design he went to work as a freelance photographer, predominantly in the commercial field, working for agencies and institutions. His assignment with the Culinaria series took him to Greece for eight months, where he uncovered unusual wines, fruits, and various Greek dishes. He spent time with people at work and at play and, of course, at the table, all the while endeavoring to capture the country, its specialties, and its atmosphere in the photographs that illustrate this book. Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes of Greece open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.</Text>

			<Text>Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes from Italy’s various regions open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.  The “land where lemons bloom” was already a fascinating travel destination long before Goethe identified it as such. The grand culture and varied landscapes of Italy have attracted and inspired artists and writers of every epoch. Since the time of classic “educational trips” to the ancient sites of the Apennine Peninsula, ever-increasing numbers of travelers have developed an affinity to this country and the ars vivendi of its inhabitants. Indeed, the simple and yet ingenious Italian cuisine has become the expression of countless visitors’ approach toward life.  In 496 pages and more than 1,200 color photographs, Culinaria Italy introduces not only kitchen and cellar, but also the land and people who reside between the Alps’ peaks and the pointed toe of the Italian “boot”. More than 380 time-tested recipes from every region of the country ensure that a feast for the palate can follow the stimulating reading pleasure. The Editors Claudia Piras studied philosophy and literature and works as  an editor, author, and translator.   Eugenio Medagliani is the proprietor of a firm in Milan that has specialized in sales of utensils for professional kitchens since 1860. For more than 25 years he has published the magazine Il Cuoco, the journal of the organization Federcuochi Italiana. He also works with diverse fine food journals and television programs and is a member of the international jury of the gourmet association Slow Food.  The Photographer Ruprecht Stempell has photographed the stars of the international media world for music and lifestyle magazines. In conjunction with international aid organizations, reports about slums in Ethiopia, street children in Brazil, child labor in Bangladesh, as well as photo documentaries of Nepal and Romania followed. Stempell has also contributed picture material to additional volumes of the Culinaria series.</Text>

			<Text>Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes from France’s various regions open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.  France has long been and remains the stronghold of culinary culture. No other country in the world can boast such an immense richness of specialties or comes even close to offering such an extraordinary wealth of noble restaurants, in which thousands of chefs nurture the tradition of grand cuisine and with notable creativity continue to produce new culinary delights. This gastronomic tour demonstrates how landscape, climate, and culture impact France’s cuisine. Master chefs from all corners of the country have contributed to a new, up-to-date portrait of this nation of gourmands, which includes something for everyone, whether you prefer to enjoy the tastes of France in person or in your own kitchen, or let yourself be enchanted in an entirely new way by the selection of fabulous photographs, enticing recipes, and knowledgeable texts about French cuisine. The Editor: André Dominé, in spite of his French-sounding name, comes from Hamburg, Germany. He put down roots in a winegrowing village in the south of France in 1981, and for more than a dozen years he has sniffed and sipped his way through French cellars, kitchens, and landscapes. Part of the project from its beginning, he animates fans of the Culinaria series to retrace his pleasurable discoveries and experience them for themselves.  The Photographer: Günter Beer discovered his passion for the subject of food while working on the European Specialties volume of the Culinaria series. Further publications with Könemann followed. Beer has lived, worked, and enjoyed life in Barcelona, Spain for several years. Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes from France’s various regions open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.</Text>

			<Text>Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes from Spain’s various regions open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.  Spain – its cuisine is as colorful as the country is large. While to the north the traditions of the wandering herdsmen are still maintained and tracking dogs search out truffles, exotic fruits that entered the country with the Arabs flourish in the south. This Culinaria title whets your appetite to explore Spain with all your senses. It describes an incomparable panorama of cultural and culinary traditions, as well as an overview of the most important winegrowing regions of the land. Its 488 pages and more than 1,200 photographs clearly illustrate how landscape, climate, and various cultures have left their mark on the diverse cuisine of the country – from Alboraya in the Levant to Zaragoza in the north, from the omnipresent garlic mayonnaise alioli to zamburiña mussels. More than 200 recipes drawn from every region ensure that the fascinating reading also becomes a feast for the palate. The Author Marion Trutter lived in Mexico for a year before studying Spanish literature, American studies, and communications in Munich. For many years she was an editor with responsibility for Spanish and Latin American topics for a well-known travel magazine. She was in charge of text for a sports magazine for two years before launching a freelance career in 1992. She is now a freelance journalist specializing in travel and Spanish-speaking countries for magazines, newspapers, books, and radio.  Photographer: Günter Beer discovered his passion for the subject of food while working on the European Specialties volume of the Culinaria series. Further publications with Könemann followed, but the photographer is particularly excited about Spanish cuisine and culture because he has lived, worked, and enjoyed life in Barcelona, Spain for several years. Reports about every aspect of food and the culture it stems  from, both practical and anecdotal, and naturally all the most important recipes from Spain’s various regions open up a culinary universe that you can capture in your own kitchen.</Text>

			<Text>The ‘loft” phenomenon began in the 1970s as a solution some American artists found to the lack of living space. Today, lofts have become not only part of a culture and a life style cherished by many people in the big cities, but also a reference point for contemporary architecture and decoration. These open industrial spaces constitute a place where living, working or creating take place in an area open to the public. Through numerous international examples, this volume of 1,000 pages of illustrations and full-coloured photographs, showcases the most recent projects and the most ingenious solutions. Designers, architects, and owners have taken the maximum advantage of these cold spaces, transforming them into luxuriously bright open areas by using original structural elements.</Text>

			<Text>Byzantium - Constantinople - Istanbul: fonded as a Greek settlement on the Bosporus, the city's history is replete with significant political and cultural developments. The Hagia Sophia stems from the early Christian era; the Middle Ages bequeathed us churches and monasteries rich in mosaics as well as illuminated manuscripts and icons; and the cultural Renaissance in 1453 brought magnificent palaces and mosques, calligraphic treasures, and book and miniature paintings inspired by Persian and Arabic forms.</Text>
